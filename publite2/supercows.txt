# This is a list of gamemasters/administrators that can observe longturn games and post anonymous messages (that look like they're coming
# from the server). Always keep this list in the format of Nickname:Game port, see the below commented out example. The capitalisation 
# of the nicknames doesn't matter. The lines can't have anything else except for the nickname, colon and the port,
# otherwise you could cause serious issues, though any spaces will get removed and don't matter. 
# Do NOT for some reason put 1000 characters on one line in this file or you will make everyone admin.
# In order to post anonymously in-game, prefix your message with "(server)", so for example "(server) The game is over!"
# Any leading or trailing spaces will be removed from that message automatically. Make sure not to add : after (server)
# Warning: There is a bug which causes the server to crash, if this file contains a line with just some spaces.
