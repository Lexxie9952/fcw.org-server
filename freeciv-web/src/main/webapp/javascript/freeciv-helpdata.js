    "text": "Freeciv is a turn-based strategy game, in which each player becomes the leader of a civilization. You compete against several opponents to found cities, use them to support a military and economy, and finally to complete an empire that survives all encounters with its neighbors to emerge victorious. Each opponent may be either another human or be controlled by the computer. All players begin at the dawn of history with a handful of units -- typically with an explorer and a couple of settlers in 4000 BCE -- and race to expand outward from those humble beginnings. <br><br> Achieving success requires a balance between economic expansion, military strength, and technological development. Not only must you develop all three in concert to both expand and successfully defend your empire, but any of the three may provide victory over your opponents: <br><br>  - As in other games of conquest and expansion, you are declared the winner by default once the last city and unit of every other civilization is destroyed. <br><br>  - Once technological progress has brought you into the space age, you may launch a spacecraft destined for Alpha Centauri, the first civilization whose craft reaches the system wins. <br><br>  - In the absence of other means to determine victory, the game will end after 5000 turns if no spacecraft have yet been launched. The surviving civilizations are then rated, and the one with the highest score is the winner. <br><br> A word of warning: Freeciv is highly customizable, both through run-time configuration and through custom rulesets which can change almost any aspect of the game rules. This help system tries to adapt to different rules, but may not completely cover rulesets which are very different from the classic rules.<br><br>"

    "text": "While every game is different, there's a basic strategy which most players follow, especially at the start of the game. <br><br> These steps may vary depending upon the server options, but in general, the steps are:  <br><br>  0. Choosing the first city site.<br> 1. Mapping the countryside.<br> 2. Defending the cities.<br> 3. Deciding which units to build first.<br> 4. Improving the land.<br> 5. Deciding where to build cities.<br> 6. Taking care of the cities.<br> 7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).<br> 8. Exploring the world.<br> 9. Things to keep in mind.<br> 10. Making your own strategy for the game.<br> <br><br>  0. Choosing the first city site.<br><br>    Start the game by wandering around BRIEFLY to find a good place to build the first city.  Don't feel tempted to investigate any yellow-roofed villages yet - they might contain barbarian tribes.  Build the city close to resources and perhaps close to the sea.  Keep in mind that the city you build first will be your capital!  The idea is to balance the quality of the site you find against getting your first city established as early as possible. <br><br>  1. Mapping the countryside.<br><br>    After the capital city has been founded, it will start producing a warrior unit.  These units can be used to rove around exploring the countryside.  Remember, it is risky to leave a city undefended, so perhaps keep the first warrior in the city, and use the following one to explore.  If you started the game with an explorer unit, use that to explore, obviously! <br><br>  2. Defending the cities.<br><br>    At this point, defend your cities by always leaving a warrior unit in them.  As your civilization develops units with a greater defense strength, replace the obsolete units with new ones to ensure your cities have maximum defense.  The units most often used for defense are (in order of strength):  Warrior, Phalanx, Pikemen, Musketeers, and Riflemen. <br><br>     Keep in mind that with some types of government, military units inside or outside cities can reduce or create unhappiness. Also remember that when a land unit is inside a city, it gets a 50% defensive bonus, as if fortified.  When a new city is built, the city starts to build the best available defensive unit from the above list. <br><br>  3. Deciding which units to build first.<br><br>    After building one or two Warrior units, start building Settlers.  Settlers take city population, but if you picked a good city site, your city should be big enough by now.  Settlers are best put to use founding new cities, while they can also build agricultural improvements (see the next section), it is better to use Workers for this when available, as unlike Settlers, Workers do not consume food from their parent city.  Keep in mind that a large population increases both the amount of productivity and your civilization's research rate, not to mention that cities secure land for your empire, so founding new cities should be a high priority initially. <br><br>  4. Improving the land.<br><br>    Each city has an area of land around it that can be used for growing food, producing goods, and generating trade.  This output can be increased by using Workers (or Settlers) to improve the land close to your cities.  The land can be improved with irrigation (increasing food), roads (allowing units to move faster and increasing trade), and mines (increasing production), among other improvements. <br><br>  5. Deciding where to build cities.<br><br>    The best location for a city is a matter of taste.  A city which is placed near the sea is easier to spot by opponents, but can also serve as a port for sea-going units.  (They also usually need a coastal defense later on.)  The best strategy is to build a few of both, but keep in mind that your opponents will find it harder to locate your city if you don't build it by the sea. <br><br>  6. Taking care of the cities.<br><br>    Every city has a band of citizens.  The number of citizens depends on the city's population.  When you click on a city, you can see how the land around the city is being used.  You can assign your citizens to the land, or they can be specialists that contribute to your civilization in other ways.  Especially at the start of the game, care should be taken to ensure that the citizens are employed so that they maximize growth, trade and production. <br><br>     If too much food is being generated, a citizen can be taken off the land by clicking on the occupied land tile.  This citizen can then be transferred to the other duties mentioned previously. <br><br>     If you move all of your citizens into the city and right-click on the central tile of the land, the citizens will be rearranged to maximize food production. <br><br>     The golden rule of taking care of a city is that there should be at least as many happy citizens as unhappy citizens.  A city where this is not so falls into disorder, such cities are labeled with a raised fist or a lightning bolt (depending on the tileset).  Take care not to let this happen to any of your cities, as cities in disorder produce nothing, and are prone to revolt. <br><br>  7. Interacting with other players (diplomacy).<br><br>    When one of your units first meets a unit of another nation, or finds one of their cities (or equally if they find you), a basic contact is established between the two nations.  This provides each with basic intelligence about the other, which can be accessed from the 'Nations' report. <br><br>     This communication will lapse after a set number of turns with no contact.  Establishing an embassy will give a more permanent communication channel, as well as more advanced intelligence such as details of technology.  Embassies are one-way - the nation hosting the embassy receives no benefit - and once established, cannot be revoked. <br><br>     If you are in contact with another player, then you can arrange a diplomatic meeting.  From the 'Nations' report, this is done by clicking on the nation with whom you wish to meet and selecting 'Meet'.  If the entry under the embassy column is not blank and the other player is connected (or is a server AI) then a treaty dialog will pop up. <br><br>     In this dialog you can negotiate an exchange of assets (maps, vision, advances, cities, or gold), embassies, or binding pacts such as a cease-fire or peace.  There is no need to trade like for like, you can trade, say, an advance or city for gold - you can consider this buying and selling.  Each player builds a list of offered items.  To remove an item from the list, double-click on it.  When both players indicate satisfaction, the pact is concluded. <br><br>     Pacts affect where your units can go and what they can do, and a pact with one nation can affect your relations with others.  Under authoritarian governments such as Monarchy you can break a pact at any time, but the representative governments (Republic and Democracy) have a senate which will block the unprovoked cancelation of a treaty, unless a foreign Diplomat or Spy sparks a diplomatic incident, the only way to dissolve a pact in this situation is to dissolve your government.  The details of pacts are described in the Diplomacy section. <br><br>     A couple of notes: <br><br>    - You can't give away your capital. <br><br>    - You can only request property that you know about, so you can't request technology unless you have an embassy, and if you can't see a city on your map, then you can't request it.  Of course, the owner of that city can still offer it to you, in which case the area around the city is shown on your map before you accept the treaty. <br><br>    - One important thing to note: when a city is transferred, any units in the field and supported by that city are also transferred (but not those sitting in other cities).  So make sure the other player isn't getting a better deal than you expect. <br><br>  8. Exploring the world.<br><br>    After you have fortified your cities with troops, build Triremes in the cities near the sea.  Use the Triremes to map the world in search of opponents and new lands.  If you are on an island, you should spend less on military and more on expansion.  Or if you are located close to an opponent, it is truly a good idea to make a peace treaty and share the advances you have made. Diplomatic units are very useful here, and WILL pay off later. <br><br>  9. Things to keep in mind.<br><br>  - What the next advance you'll need is.<br><br>  - What your tax, luxury and research rates are currently set to.<br><br>  - Treaties are often broken, so don't neglect defense...<br><br>  - Some wonders can be made obsolete. <br><br>  10. Making your own strategy for the game.<br><br>    These basic concepts will allow you to play the game pretty well, especially in the beginning of the game.  But to improve, you need to study the various units and advances, and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!

  "help_terrain": {
    "name": "Terrain",
    "text": "Terrain serves three roles: the theater upon which your units battle rival civilizations, the landscape across which your units travel, and the medium which your cities work to produce resources. The different types of terrain each have different strengths and drawbacks, see the sections on each terrain type for details. <br><br> Terrain affects combat very simply: when a unit is attacked, its defense strength is multiplied by the defense factor ('bonus') of the terrain beneath it. (However, some types of units do not enjoy this bonus, in the classic ruleset, only land units do.) See the help section on Combat for further details. <br><br> Terrain can complicate the movement of units. For instance, in the classic ruleset, moving onto rough terrain such as Mountains can cost land units more than flat terrain like Plains, although sea and air units always expend one movement point to move one tile. <br><br> Tiles within range of a city may be worked by that city to produce food, production, and trade points, and the quantity of each produced depends on the terrain. These three products are so important that we specify the output of a tile simply by listing them with slashes in between: for example, '1/2/0' describes a tile that each turn when it is being worked produces one food point, two production points, and no trade points. In addition to the characteristic output of the terrain, some tiles have an additional special resource that boosts one or two of the products. See the Economy section for more information on the use of these products. <br><br> The net benefit of a tile for your city depends on your government type as well as city improvements and wonders. <br><br> It is possible for your units to change the terrain and hence its effects, see the section on Terrain Alterations for more details.<br><br>"

  "help_terrain_alterations": {
    "name": "Terrain Alterations",
    "text": "Certain units have the ability to alter terrain tiles in several ways: they may add or remove tile improvements, remove unwanted features such as pollution, or change the base terrain type entirely. <br><br> Tile improvements typically provide some lasting bonus for as long as they are present, such as a production bonus when a city works the tile. Roads or paths typically ease movement, if they connect to a similar road on an adjacent tile, and bases often provide protection and refueling. The available tile improvements are described in the following sections. <br><br> Improvements can be built by issuing one of several orders to a suitable unit while on a suitable tile: 'mine', 'irrigate', 'road', or 'build base' (although whether the order builds an improvement of the same name is up to the ruleset). Terrain alterations can also be requested from the city map (see the help on Cities). <br><br> Terrain can sometimes be permanently converted into a type more suitable to the player's needs, although this usually takes longer than adding an improvement. Converting terrain from one type to another in this way may destroy existing improvements, if the new terrain is unsuitable, and may also remove access to special resources if they were specific to the original terrain type. <br><br> The requirements for terrain conversion are set by the ruleset. It can be initiated in several ways: <br><br>  - By issuing 'irrigate' or 'mine' orders when on terrain unsuitable for tile improvements. <br><br>  - By issuing the special 'transform' order. This often causes more radical transformations. <br><br> In some rulesets, units can even reclaim land from water tiles, and similarly land can be transformed to water, although such radical transformations may require a certain number of surrounding tiles to already be land or water respectively. Terrain-altering units that cannot reach the existing terrain may have to be loaded onto a suitable vessel, and if necessary and possible, they will move to safe neighboring tiles when the conversion is complete. <br><br> Units may also be able to destroy terrain alterations, by pillaging, typically more kinds of unit can pillage an improvement than could build it in the first place. Some tile features can only be removed by specialized units, with the 'clean pollution' or 'clean fallout' orders. <br><br> Terrain conversions cannot be undone in this way, for example, in the classic ruleset, if a Forest tile has been irrigated to convert it into Plains, you cannot convert it back into a Forest by pillaging -- to do so, you would have to convert the tile again with a suitable unit. <br><br> The time it takes a unit to alter terrain depends on its movement rate. The following table shows the number of turns required for a unit with 1 movement point to complete an activity, these numbers are reduced for units with faster move rates (such as Engineers in the classic ruleset). The time taken can be reduced further by several units working together as a team, if two or more units are working on the same task on the same tile, their efforts will be added together each turn until the task is finished. Be careful not to dedicate too many units to one task, though, excess effort can be wasted, and groups of terrain improving units are often vulnerable to enemy attacks. <br><br> \"$TerrainAlterations \""

Borders determine what land your citizens can work and where you can found new cities, and whether your units are considered to be aggressively deployed by your citizens (see the section on Happiness). Borders also come into play when there is a diplomatic pact between nations (see the section on Diplomacy). <br><br> Founding a city establishes a claim on an area of land around the city. In the classic ruleset, once claimed, a tile that can be directly worked by a city can not change ownership unless the city does (or is destroyed). However, the ownership of land that is out of range of any city can change depending on factors such as the relative size of nearby nations' cities. Other rulesets may differ in which, if any, tiles are permanently claimed by a city. <br><br> Normally borders extend into water only for tiles adjacent to a city, beyond that, only narrow inlets and inland lakes can usually be claimed. Some rulesets may allow water tiles to be claimed as easily as land tiles in some circumstances, although the classic ruleset does not.

Cities producing more food than they require accumulate the surplus in their granary, while those producing less than they require deplete their granary. When food is needed but none remains, the city population starves, killing food-consuming units first, followed by citizens, until the food deficit ends. <br><br> Excess food can increase the population: the city granary has a limited capacity, and once full the city grows by one citizen and the granary starts again at empty. But since granary capacity increases with population, each citizen is more costly than the last, making this mode of growth important only for small cities. (An alternative way for cities to grow is 'rapture', described in the section on Happiness.)"
  },
  "help_production": {
    "name": "Production",
    "text": "Production points (also known as 'shields') represent manufacturing output. In the classic ruleset, most units require production points as upkeep, and demand them from their home city, although under autocratic regimes each city supports a few units for free. If city production drops too low, the units that cannot be supported are automatically disbanded. You can also disband most types of unit at any time. If a unit is disbanded while in a city, half of its production cost will usually be put towards that city's surplus. <br><br> Production points in excess of any required by the city's units are put towards whichever unit, building, or wonder has been selected as the city's current product. Just as food points accumulate in the city granary and yield a citizen when it reaches full, so production points accumulate until the cost of the product has been achieved. Products appear in their city when complete -- units appear on the map while improvements and wonders are added to their city's list of structures. Any leftover production points remain available to be applied towards the next project. <br><br> Some units, such as Settlers, are built from city population as well as production points, the city size will reduce when the unit is built. By default, a city will not finish building a unit that would take all of the city's remaining population, in this case, production points will continue to accumulate until the city is of sufficient size. You can allow a city to be disbanded from the city's dialog, however, you cannot disband your last city this way. <br><br> In the classic ruleset, a city can build at most one product per turn, regardless of its production surplus. However, in some rulesets, factors such as city size and technology may enable a single city to produce more than one unit in a single turn under certain conditions. A city with multiple 'build slots', ordered to build a unit, can build as many of that single kind of unit per turn as its production surplus allows, up to the number of slots. Units which cost city population to build are an exception to this rule, they can only be built singly, as can buildings. <br><br> A city can be given a list of several products to build in its 'worklist', avoiding the need to pay attention to it every few turns. Each item on the worklist represents a single product (such as a unit)finished all the work you have given it to do, it will try to build the last item again if possible, otherwise it will choose a new target itself. If a city is currently producing gold (building Coinage in the classic rules), an activity which never completes, putting an item on its worklist will cause it to stop producing gold and start working on the new item next turn. In rulesets which permit it, a city may take several units of the same type off its worklist in a single turn, but if a different kind of item is reached, production pauses until the following turn. This can be used to limit the number of units produced by highly productive cities. <br><br> Each player is free to build any products that his technology has made available, with a few restrictions, see the sections on Units, City Improvements, and Wonders of the World for more information. Be careful -- the game even gives you the freedom to produce units you cannot support and buildings whose upkeep you cannot afford, both of which will be disbanded immediately after completion. <br><br> You can always change the product on which a city is working, though you lose half of the accumulated production points when switching from a building, unit, or wonder to a product from one of the other two categories. You can spend gold to complete a project in one turn by hitting the Buy button on the city dialog. <br><br> Some production points may be lost to waste, although there is no waste in the classic rules. Waste can result in your cities not building anything. <br><br> Cities with a large production output contribute to pollution, which affects the tiles around the city. See the Terrain help.<br><br>"

  "help_trade": {
    "name": "Trade",
    "text": "Trade points reflect wealth generated in each city by external commerce. Some trade points may be lost to corruption, which varies among forms of government, and tends to increase with distance from your center of government. Each city distributes its remaining trade points among three uses: gold, in the form of taxes, goes into your national treasury, luxury points influence citizen morale, and science points ('bulbs') contribute towards the discovery of new technology. <br><br> You must choose a single ratio for your civilization by which trade points are distributed among these three uses. Though you may alter the tax rates on any turn, you are constrained to multiples of ten percent, and most forms of government limit their maximum value. <br><br> Having this single ratio does not impact gold and science, because gold and technological progress are both empire-wide tallies. Luxury is more problematic, however, because its effect is local -- it affects only the city producing it. Thus, while it would be convenient for unhappy cities to invest all their trade in luxury while others invested in science or taxes instead, you will instead have to compromise among the needs of all your cities (although there may be ways to make local adjustments, such as assigning citizens as entertainers in the classic ruleset). See the section on Happiness for more details on the effect of luxuries. <br><br> Besides working terrain gifted with rare commodities, or logistical benefits such as waterways or roads, you can increase trade by using units to establish permanent trade routes between two cities, if the ruleset allows it. <br><br> The ruleset may limit the ability to trade or the yield from doing so depending on whether the two cities are on different continents and/or in different nations, for international trade routes, on the diplomatic status of the two trade partners, and for domestic routes, there must be a minimum distance between the two cities, controlled by the 'trademindist' server option (default nine tiles). <br><br> A trade route is established when a suitable unit (in the classic ruleset, a Caravan or Freight unit) enters an eligible city. For your own or allied cities, you need to issue the 'Establish Trade Route' command. This creates a trade route between the unit's home city (which might be different from the city that originally produced it) and the destination. <br><br> The origin civilization of the unit gains immediate revenue in gold and science from selling its trade goods at the destination city. The initial revenue depends on the trade already produced by the two cities involved and their distance apart. The destination civilization learns about the location of the origin city, if it is not already known. <br><br> The ongoing trade route that is established benefits both its origin and destination cities equally by generating trade points for each city every turn. The amount of ongoing trade increases with the size of each city and the distance between them, and may also depend on the factors mentioned above. The trade relationship also gives each civilization limited ongoing intelligence about the partner city. If a trade route ever becomes unsustainable -- for instance, if war breaks out in a ruleset where enemies cannot trade -- it may be permanently canceled. <br><br> Each city can only support a limited number of trade routes (the exact limit is set by ruleset and circumstance). If you attempt to establish more, the trade route with the smallest ongoing revenue is canceled if it would be less than the new route. (Otherwise, the origin civilization can still gain initial revenue by entering the marketplace and selling trade goods, but it is reduced to a third.) <br><br> This limit is enforced only when attempting to establish a new route. If you temporarily lose the ability to establish as many trade routes as a city already has, existing ones are not affected. <br><br> Beware: in rulesets where plague is enabled, it can travel along trade routes. See the section on Plague for more details. <br><br> To view the current trade routes of a city, click and hold over the Trade: line in the Overview tab in the city view.<br><br>"

A city may grow to include dozens of citizens, some working within the city while others are dispatched as new settlers. Famine, war, and plague kill citizens and reduce population, with the loss of its last citizen a city disappears (in the classic ruleset, this can leave ruins, although these have no effect on gameplay). <br><br> While city growth should usually be your aim, it comes with challenges. As cities grow, managing happiness becomes a problem, this is described in its own section. Depending on the ruleset, pollution (described in the Terrain help), plague, and migration can also be issues. <br><br> Each city may work the terrain within its reach. In the classic ruleset, this is a fixed radius of approximately three tiles, giving access to 20 tiles on rectangular maps, or 18 tiles on hexagonal ones, in addition to the city center tile. In other rulesets it may be different, and may vary depending on factors such as the size of the city and known technologies. <br><br> To extract resources from a tile, you must have a citizen working there. You cannot begin working a tile which a neighboring city is already working, nor can you work terrain upon which an enemy unit is standing, or terrain inside another player's borders. Thus you can simulate conditions of siege by stationing your units atop valuable resources around an enemy city. Units can also be ordered to pillage, which damages improvements. Worker units could even transform the terrain to make the tile less productive. <br><br> The section on Terrain describes how the output of each tile is affected by the terrain, the presence of special resources such as game or minerals, and tile improvements built by units. Note that the tile on which the city itself rests -- the city center -- gets worked for free, without being assigned a citizen. The city's tile may also receive other benefits. In the classic ruleset, it always produces at least one food and one production point regardless of terrain, gains whatever advantages the terrain offers with an irrigation system (because cities come with water systems built-in)developed with roads. Other rulesets may differ in detail. <br><br> The roles of citizens are controlled from the City dialog. Citizens working the land are represented by three numbers showing their output on the tile they are working. Clicking on these numbers will remove the citizen from the tile, turning them into a specialist (see the section on Specialists for more details)row of citizen icons. You can click another tile to assign the citizen to work it, or click on the specialist icon to change their specialist role. <br><br> Clicking on the city center tile in the city map will automatically choose citizen roles and tiles to work, with an emphasis on food production and hence growth. Citizen roles are also automatically assigned when a city grows, you may want to inspect cities that have just grown and adjust the role in which the new citizen has been placed. You can set different priorities for a city with the Citizen Governor, see its help section. <br><br> You can also request tile alterations from the city map, as an alternative to explicitly instructing units to make them.

These 'worker tasks' will be carried out by any units capable of them that are in 'auto settler' mode. <br><br> Citizens have a nationality distinct from that of the state they inhabit. When a city grows due to food surplus, new citizens take the nationality of the city's current owner, but when a city is conquered or otherwise transferred, its citizens retain their original nationality, as do any immigrants. Units founding or contributing citizens to a city can also bring their own nationality. <br><br> Citizens of another nationality will work in your cities just the same as your own, and behave the same in most respects, but they may become unhappy when you are at war with their associated state, their presence makes it cheaper for their state's agents to incite revolt in your cities, and if migration is enabled, they have an increased tendency to migrate to their state's cities. Over time, citizens may be assimilated into their home city, depending on ruleset settings. <br><br> Some rulesets do not have nationality, in this case, citizens always consider their nationality to be that of their home city. If nationality is enabled, you can see the cultural makeup of your cities and any consequent effects on happiness in the City dialog, on the Happiness tab. <br><br> Cities may be enhanced with a wide variety of buildings, which can improve their productivity, their military strength, or give them new abilities.

    "text": "Keeping your citizens happy (or at least content) is one of the most important objectives in Freeciv. When your citizens become unhappy, your cities will fall into disorder, which disrupts production, but when your citizens are happy, your cities will celebrate, and your production will increase greatly. (If migration is enabled, happiness also affects the relative desirability of cities, see the section on Migration for details.) <br><br> Each citizen working the land is either happy, content, unhappy, or angry. The normal state of a working citizen is contentment. However, as your cities grow larger, crowding causes citizens to become unhappy. In the classic rules, each citizen in a city after the fourth will be generated unhappy, instead of content. <br><br> If the number of unhappy citizens in a city exceeds the number of happy citizens, the city falls into disorder. A city in disorder produces no food or production surplus, science, or taxes, only luxury production remains. Cities which are in disorder are also easier for enemy agents to incite to revolt. Prolonged disorder under certain governments can lead to a spontaneous national revolution, overthrowing your government. <br><br> It should be stressed that only citizens working the land vary in morale -- specialists enjoy enough privilege to remain perpetually content (see the section on Specialists). Thus one solution to the problem of an unhappy citizen is simply to assign that citizen to the role of a specialist. But if cities are ever to work more than four terrain tiles at once, the problem of morale must be confronted more directly. <br><br> There are many ways of making unhappy citizens content, which does prevent disorder but is without further benefit. Producing happy citizens can balance the effect of unhappy citizens and also bring other benefits. <br><br> Cities that are sufficiently large celebrate when at least half their citizens are happy and none remain unhappy. The effects of celebration vary, in the classic ruleset, they depend on your government type: <br><br>  - Under Anarchy or Despotism, you will not suffer the normal production penalty for tiles which produce more than 2 points of any resource (food, production, or trade). <br><br>  - Under Monarchy or Communism, your city will gain the trade bonus of Republican/Democratic governments: 1 bonus trade point in any tile which already produces at least 1 trade. <br><br>  - Under a Republic or a Democracy, your city will enter 'rapture': its population will increase by 1 each turn until there is no excess food or until the number of happy citizens is no longer sufficient for celebration. Without rapture, large cities can grow only by struggling to produce a food surplus -- which can be difficult enough -- and then waiting dozens of turns for their granary to fill. <br><br> In small empires, as already stated, the fifth citizen in each city is the first unhappy one. As you gain more cities, this limit actually decreases, to simulate the difficulty of imposing order upon a large empire. The precise thresholds depend on government type, see the section on Government for details. <br><br>Thus, you may find that founding or conquering a city triggers widespread disorder across your empire. Continued empire growth may lead to further penalty steps. In empires that grow beyond the point where no citizens are naturally content, angry citizens will appear, these must all be made merely unhappy before any unhappy citizens can be made content, but in all other respects behave as unhappy citizens. <br><br>Luxury makes citizens happy. For every two luxury points a city produces, one content citizen is made happy (if there are no content citizens left, unhappy citizens become content then happy). Each city receives back some of the trade points it produces as luxury points according to your empire's tax rates, see the section on Trade. Luxury points may also be produced by other means, such as entertainer specialists in the classic ruleset. <br><br> There are several city improvements that will make content those remaining citizens that are unhappy due to crowding, such as Temples and Colosseums in the classic rules. Some wonders of the world can also have this effect. See the appropriate sections for details. <br><br> Military units can affect city happiness. Under authoritarian regimes this is helpful, as military units stationed in a city can prevent unhappiness by imposing martial law. However, under representative governments, citizens become unhappy when their city is supporting military units which have been deployed into an aggressive stance. This includes units not inside your national borders, a friendly city (including the cities of your allies), or a suitable base within three tiles of a friendly city, however, certain units ('field units') are inherently aggressive and cause unhappiness regardless of location. <br><br> If you are at war with a civilization and some of your citizens are of that nationality, those citizens may also become unhappy. <br><br> These forms of unhappiness are distinct from that caused by overcrowding, and cannot be offset by luxuries, or by most city improvements. In the classic ruleset, Police Stations and the Women's Suffrage wonder can offset unhappiness caused by units, and only a few wonders -- such as J.S. Bach's Cathedral -- can offset any kind of unhappiness, even that caused by military or diplomatic tensions. <br><br> The Happiness tab on the city dialog will give detailed insight into the mood of the citizenry and its causes.<br><br>"

Notice that many bonuses are possible for defenders, but few for attackers, aside from veteran status, an attacking unit can mostly expect circumstance to work against it. <br><br>First, the attacker's strength is modified. <br><br>  - If the attacker is a veteran, its strength is multiplied by the bonus associated with its veteran level. <br><br>  - Some rulesets (but not the classic rules) have 'tired attacks': a unit that attacks with less than a full movement point will have its strength proportionally reduced. <br><br>Next, the defender's strength is modified. <br><br>  - If the defender is a veteran, then its strength is multiplied by the bonus associated with its veteran level. <br><br> - Then the defender's strength is multiplied by the defense factor of the terrain it occupies. <br><br> - If the defender is fortified, or is of a type that could fortify and is inside a city, its strength is multiplied by 1.5. <br><br>  - Ruleset-specific bonuses are applied: <br><br>   - The defender's strength is doubled if it is a Pikeman unit defending against a mounted unit. <br><br>   - If the defender is an AEGIS Cruiser defending against airborne units (including missiles and Helicopters), the defense is quintupled. <br><br>   - The defender's strength is doubled again if it is in a city with a SAM Battery and the attacker is an air unit (other than a Helicopter or a missile). <br><br>   - An SDI Defense doubles the defender's strength against missile attacks. <br><br>   - If the attacker is a ship and the defender is in a city with a Coastal Defense, the defender's strength is doubled. <br><br>   - Against land units (other than Howitzers) and Helicopters, defending units in a city with City Walls have their strength tripled. <br><br>   - If the defender is in a fortress (and not a city), its strength is doubled. <br><br>   - Finally, if the attacker is a fighter and the defender is a helicopter, the defender's strength is halved. <br><br> If, after these modifications, the attacker has a strength of 0, it automatically loses. Otherwise, if the defender has a strength of 0, the defender loses. <br><br>The firepower of the attacker and defender are also modified. <br><br> - If the defender is a ship and is inside a city the firepower of the attacker is doubled and the firepower of the ship is set to 1. <br><br> - If a fighter is attacking a helicopter the firepower of the helicopter is set to 1. <br><br> - If neither unit could move to where the other is, such as a ship attacking a land unit on land, the firepower of both is set to 1. <br><br> After these preliminaries, combat occurs, as long as both units are still alive (i.e., hit points are greater than 0). Each round, a random number between 1 and the sum of the attacker's and defender's strengths is generated. If this number is greater than the defender's strength, the defender loses hit points equal to the attacker's firepower. Otherwise, the attacker loses hit points equal to the defender's firepower. The first unit to reach 0 hit points (or negative hit points) loses. <br><br>Whichever unit survives the fight has a chance of being promoted a veteran level.

(However it is possible for this to be disabled on the server.) <br><br> In the classic rules, before you can build spaceship parts, the Apollo Program wonder must have been built by any player. You also need specific technologies to build the different spaceship parts: see the help texts for Space Structural, Space Component, and Space Module, under City Improvements. (If there are no help texts for these items, it probably means the 'SPACERACE' victory type is not enabled in the 'victories' server setting for your game.) <br><br> When you have started building your spaceship, you can see it with the 'Spaceship' command in the Report menu. To see spaceships of other players, select the player in the Nations report and click 'Spaceship'. <br><br> If the success probability is below 100%, some fraction of the people on board may not survive the journey. This reduces the score bonus from the spaceship, but it still counts as a win. <br><br> If the capital of a civilization is captured, a spaceship that has been launched will be lost, so defend your capital well! <br><br> TIP:  If an enemy civilization has launched a spaceship, try to quickly build a light spaceship with many propulsion units that will arrive earlier. The only other option is to capture their capital.<br><br>"
