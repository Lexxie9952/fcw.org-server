Tribesmen can explore, moving over terrain with no penalty. They don’t obey or exert ZOC. They can build roads, quays, irrigate, or mine at half the rate of Workers. 
Tribesmen can make basic diplomatic contact and freely Investigate cities. They can carry Goods and enter nations with whom you are at Peace; cargo is visible to everyone. They can do primitive combat—they can’t conquer cities and only attack for 10 combat rounds. 
Tribesmen help build nations by recycling into city production with a 2× bonus, donating their life-work of 20 shields into any output EXCEPT units. ** Changing production targets loses their work! ** 
Tribesmen lose many versatility bonuses as you become more civilized. For 3 turns they gain +⅓ move. After 20 turns, they lose another ⅓ move and lose their vision, tile-work, and recycle bonuses. At such point, recycling into a building or wonder yields 10 shields.

Pilgrims are wayfaring migrants from Theocratic nations. Like Zealots, they have no upkeep if under a Theocratic government. Heeding the call of ecclesiastic authority, Pilgrims can be guided from one city to another in order to transfer population from city to city. Pilgrims have no population cost, so can be thought of as geographically controlled rapture for the price of 10 shields.

Pilgrims can Establish Home City in any allied city that is Theocracy, allowing control to pass between nations who share the same faith.

Ottoman Janissaries, Reconquistadores, Persian Safavid, and Indian Mughal used them to prove whose side God is on.
Falconets are huge and heavy. They have woeful accuracy but lethal firepower：they either kill or totally miss. On paper, attack odds are closest to a Musketeer (A3). Yet there is a high chance of losing when a win is expected, or winning when a loss is expected. The outcome is in God's hands! Falconeers defend a bit worse than they attack.
Righteous faith is needed to fight with slow heavy inaccurate weaponry: only Theocracies can train Falconeers. Other governments will incur high upkeep or see them retire.</b>
