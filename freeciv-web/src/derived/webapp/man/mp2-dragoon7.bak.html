Tribesmen can make basic diplomatic contact and freely Investigate cities. They can carry Goods and enter nations with whom you are at Peace; cargo is visible to everyone. They can do primitive combat—they can’t conquer cities and only attack for 10 combat rounds.

Tribesmen lose many versatility bonuses as you become more civilized. For 3 turns they gain +⅓ move. After 20 turns, they lose another ⅓ move and lose their vision, tile-work, and recycle bonuses. At such point, recycling into a building or wonder yields 10 shields.

Falconets are huge and heavy. They have woeful accuracy but lethal firepower：they either kill or totally miss. On paper, attack odds are closest to a Musketeer (A3). Yet there is a high chance of losing when a win is expected, or winning when a loss is expected. The outcome is in God's hands! Falconeers defend a bit worse than they attack.
