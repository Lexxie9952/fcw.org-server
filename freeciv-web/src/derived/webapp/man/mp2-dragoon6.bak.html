<h3 class='section'>Anarchy</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Anarchy is simply the absence of any recognizable government. Citizens are disorganized and unproductive, and will spend all income as quickly as possible, rather than paying taxes or conducting research. Under Anarchy, tiles suffer a -1 tile output penalty if they produce 3 or more of any resource.

Anarchy offers slightly less corruption than Despotism, but slightly more unhappiness.

Celebrating cities cannot rapture.
No citizens are made unhappy by each aggressive unit.
25% base corruption in cities
2% extra corruption per each tile in distance from a capital

<h3 class='section'>Theocracy</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Theocracy is formed on religious beliefs which are the law of the land.

The people are devoted and often willing to die for their faith. Cities very near a capital have very low corruption. Cost for enemies to incite cities or bribe units is 2x, but Zealots and Fanatics cannot be bribed. Cost to incite foreign cities is reduced by a third. Enemies cannot establish embassies without first making Ceasefire or Peace.

Improvements that appease unhappy citizens add +1 gold in tithes for each citizen appeased. Science output suffers -20%. Palace gives +50% to gold income in its city. In cities, two military units may impose martial law, affecting one citizen each. Pilgrims can be made to migrate and grow cities.

Celebrating cities can rapture 2 out of 5 turns.
Celebrating cities can rapture 4 out of 7 turns if they have a Cathedral building present in the city.
Each city gains +1 happy citizen.
No citizens are made unhappy by each aggressive unit.
0% base corruption in cities
1% extra corruption per each tile in distance from a capital
