<h3 class='section'>Irrigation</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>To irrigate you must have a water source on a <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency#Cardinal_Adjacency' title='Cardinal Adjacency' target='_blank'>cardinally adjacent</a> tile. Water sources are Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, Canals, Oases, or any other irrigated land.

Irrigating a suitable tile causes it to produce extra food each turn. Most tiles yield +1 extra food. A desert river that does not already benefit from an oasis will yield +2. A city on a desert river can yield +3 but only when it is manually and actually irrigated by a real unit.

Irrigating a tile with a mine or oil well will destroy the mine or oil well.

City center tiles get their terrain irrigation bonus automatically, if there is no conflicting mine or oil well on the tile. However, this does not make cities count as a water source for further irrigation. Irrigation can be built on the city tile simply to allow irrigating elsewhere, but will not give the tile any further bonus except in the case of a desert river (see above.)

• Build by issuing an "Irrigate" order (i).
Requirements to build:
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

• Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).
• Is a water source for Irrigation.

<h3 class='section'>Fishtrap</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Fishtraps become available with Refrigeration technology. Any Worker-type transported at sea can make one. A Fishtrap provides +2 food to its tile. Any Fish <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> to the tile will also be raised by +2 food output and gain +1 trade. Fishtraps must be made <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> to Fish, but cannot be made <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency#Cardinal_Adjacency' title='Cardinal Adjacency' target='_blank'>cardinally adjacent</a> to each other.

<h3 class='section'>Pollution</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Pollution appears on land tiles around cities with high production or population. Pollution creates an 'output penalty' of 50% of gross output. (The penalty amount is rounded down.) The output of all food, production, and trade is reduced by this penalty.

Each polluted tile contributes to the risk of global warming.

Pollution can only be cleared by giving Worker-types a "clean pollution" order.

Pollution from production is likely to start becoming important as your civilization becomes more industrialized, giving you buildings such as Factory and Coal Plant which boost production. Replacing a Coal Plant with cleaner forms of energy — a Hydro Plant / Hoover Dam, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant — will reduce pollution from production, as will a Recycling Center.

City population starts adding to pollution with the discovery of Industrialization. Combustion, Mass Production, and Plastics make it worse. Building a Mass Transit in a city eliminates the populational contribution to pollution. Knowledge of Environmentalism cuts it by half.

The contribution of these factors can be seen in the Main tab of a city. Once the factors exceed an allowed threshold, the excess becomes the percent chance of pollution appearing near the city each turn.

When an unused tile becomes polluted, there is the temptation to avoid the effort of cleaning it; but the spread of pollution has far more terrible results than the immediate economic impact — every polluted tile increases the chance of global warming. Each time global warming advances, the entire world loses coastal land to the sea and to jungles and swamps, and inland tiles are lost to desert. This tends to devastate cities and leads to global impoverishment.

The risk of global warming is cumulative; the longer polluted tiles are left uncleaned, the higher the risk becomes, and the risk can linger for some time even after all pollution has been cleaned. If a long time passes with an elevated risk of warming, its effects will be all the more severe when it does occur.

• May randomly appear around polluting city.
• Can be cleaned by units (time is terrain-dependent).

<h3 class='section'>Hut</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Villages (also called "Huts") are primitive communities spread across the world at the beginning of the game. Any land unit can enter a village, making the village disappear and deliver a random response. If the village is friendly, the player could receive artifacts worth some gold, a map, a mercenary military unit with no upkeep, some bulbs, or even Goods or a Boat.

Later in the game, Helicopters may also enter villages, but overflight by other aircraft will cause the villagers to take fright and disband.

• Placed by map generator.
• Can be explored by certain units.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

</pre>

<div class='item' id='extra6'>
<h3 class='section'>Farmland</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Once Refrigeration is known, irrigation systems can be upgraded to Farmland by irrigating them a second time; if the city working the tile has a Supermarket, a Farmland tile provides twice as much food.

Once you have Refrigeration, it makes sense to irrigate your city center tile twice: Supermarkets provide only a +50% bonus, whereas Farmland provides a +100% bonus.

Like irrigation, Farmland is incompatible with mines and oil wells.

• Build by issuing an "Irrigate" order (i).
Requirements to build:
• Requires knowledge of the technology Refrigeration.
• Requires Irrigation on the tile.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

• Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).
• Is a water source for Irrigation.

<h3 class='section'>Fallout</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Nuclear Fallout can appear on land tiles when a Nuclear unit is detonated. Like Pollution, it halves all output from its tile.

Every tile with Fallout also increases the risk of global nuclear winter. If nuclear winter occurs, land across the globe changes to colder terrain.

Worker types can clean Fallout. Fallout disperses and disappears randomly over time. On average, it lasts for about 6 turns.

• May randomly appear around nuclear blast.
• Can be cleaned by units (time is terrain-dependent).

<div class='item' id='extra8'>
<h3 class='section'>Hideout</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Since the dawn of time, concealed terrain was used for Hideouts, to evade aggressors or set ambushes. Hideouts require Warrior Code technology and can be built by Foot soldiers in Forests, Swamps, Mountains, Jungle, and the Ruins of a former city. They cannot be built in someone else’s territory. Units in a Hideout are invisible to other players. Land units and Helicopter-types are hidden in them. Other units will be seen. Hideouts are invisible to anyone not inside them, including their owner—so it's important to remember your Hideouts. Units inside display an icon to indicate they are hiding. For each turn unoccupied, a Hideout has a 15% chance of being lost, unless built on the ruins of a city. Hideouts can't co-exist with other base types. Units in a Hideout do not undergo stack death. The hot-key to make a hideout is shift-H. The only way to know if a tile has a Hideout is to have a Land unit inside.

Be careful! An abandoned Hideout can be used against you!

• Build by issuing a "Build Hideout" order (shift-H).
Requirements to build:
• Only Foot soldiers can build it.
• Requires knowledge of the technology Warrior Code.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.
• Requires Forest, Mountains, Jungle, or Swamp on the tile.

• Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).

• Units inside are hidden from non-allied players.
• Native to Land, Big Land, LandNoKill, LandAirSea, LandRail, LandRoad, Cargo, and Helicopter units.
  • Such units can move onto this tile even if it would not normally be suitable terrain.
• Defeat of one unit does not cause death of all other units on this tile.
• Grants vision of all <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> tiles to its owner.

<h3 class='section'>Depth</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>In Deep Ocean, modern submarines can dive deep to be undetected. “Building Depth” affects the tile so all Submarine class units are hidden to <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> units! They can still be attacked, but can’t be discovered unless moving into the tile. A Missile Submarine is required to “Build Depth”; other subs on the tile will join it at depth. The tile can’t have a Buoy or Fishtrap. The depth associated to the tile remains if any submarines are on it at turn change. A submarine may leave and return, automatically achieving depth on arrival.

• Build by issuing a "Dive Deep" order (ctrl-D).
Requirements to build:
• Requires Missile Submarine.
• Requires Deep Ocean on the tile.
• Prevented by Buoy on the tile.
• Prevented by Fishtrap on the tile.

• Submarine units on tile are hidden from non-allied players.
  • Invisible to units on <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> tiles, which can normally see Submarines.

<h3 class='section'>Tile Claim</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>A Tile Claim asserts sovereignty over a tile. A Tile Claim can be used to prevent a populous foreign city from claiming your border tiles. Or it can be used to annex border tiles from a foreign nation.

Tile Claims can be made in domestic territory with a single diplomatic unit. Non-domestic territory requires adjacency to an existing Tile Claim, and the Diplomat must be supported by another unit. Claiming foreign tiles gives casus belli. If a claimed tile is unoccupied, foreign units entering the tile will take possession of it for their own nation, also giving casus belli.

• Build by issuing a "Claim Tile" order.
  • Order can be issued from dropdown menu or Orders button.
  • Order can be issued with DO (d) ⮕ (select tile) ⮕ Build Tile Claim.

Requirements to build:
• Requires Emissary, Diplomat, Spy, or Patriarch.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.
• If in non-domestic territory:
  • Requires two units on the tile.
  • Requires a Tile Claim to be <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> to the tile.
  • Gives casus belli to tile's original owner.

• Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).

• Native to Land, Big Land, LandNoKill, and LandAirSea units.
  • Such units can move onto this tile even if it would not normally be suitable terrain.
  • Can be captured by such units if at war with the nation that currently owns it.

<h3 class='section'>Watchtower</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Watchtowers provide good vision of the surrounding terrain. An unmanned Watchtower can be claimed by a foreign unit, but the loss of the Watchtower reveals a foreign presence!

• Build by issuing a "Build Watchtower" order (shift-E).
Requirements to build:
• Requires knowledge of the technology Masonry.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

<h3 class='section'>Fort</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>After discovering Masonry, Forts can be built as rapidly constructed fortifications which give Land units +33% defense against Land, Sea, and Missile units. A Fort gives no bonuses against Air units, Helicopters, or Armor. Defending units are lost one at a time instead of the entire stack dying.

Forts can be made by Workers, Settlers, Founders, Legions, Engineers, Proletarians, and Marines.

A Fort is first required on a tile before building a Fortress. A Settler inside a Fort can claim that tile to found a city.

Forts make great outposts for border security: they establish vision one tile out on all <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> tiles, and 2 tiles out in all cardinal directions--even when unoccupied. They do not claim national territory, however.

Be careful—an unmanned Fort can be claimed by a foreign unit.

• Build by issuing a "Build Fort" order (shift-F).
Requirements to build:
• Requires knowledge of the technology Masonry.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

<h3 class='section'>Fortress</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Fortresses are available with Construction tech and can be made by Workers, Settlers, Legions, Engineers, and Proletarians. They first require a Fort to be built. Unlike Forts, they give defense bonuses against Air, Armor I, and Helicopters. Fortresses claim national territory and establish borders. They give vision which gets a bonus after Invention tech is known.

Against most land attackers, Fortresses give a defense bonus of 2x. However, against Armor I and Helicopters, the bonus is only 1.67x. Fortresses provide no bonus against Armor II.
Diplomatic units get a 25% defense bonus in diplomatic fights.

A Land unit remaining in a Fortress for a whole turn without moving recovers an additional 25% of its hit points.

<h3 class='section'>Naval Base</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Naval bases are coastal Fortresses with ocean access. Naval Bases are built on top of Forts. They allow ships to enter and receive a 2x bonus against Sea, Land, and Missile attacks. All other units get the benefits of a Fortress. Against Aircraft and Armor I, the bonus is reduced to 1.67x. Naval Bases offer no defense bonus against Armor II.
Naval bases are the only location where ships can be sure to avoid stack-death without suffering the “Pearl Harbor” penalty of A:FPx2 D:FP1.

<h3 class='section'>Quay</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Quays improve logistics on rivers and canals. River and Canal traffic can deboard to a quay for 1/3 move instead of disembarking for full moves onto <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> tiles (domestic units only.) Quays let units ferry across rivers——the ancient way to cross without a bridge! Moving from road-to-quay or quay-to-road uses 2/3 move point. Quays can also be put on Canals. In cities they allow exiting to <a href='https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Adjacency' title='Adjacency' target='_blank'>adjacent</a> roads for only 1/3 move.

Quays are RestrictedInfra. Only allied units can use them to cross rivers, and only domestic units can use them to deboard at 1/3 move. Thus, along your border, quays may be a better strategic alternative than bridged roads. Enemies will incur the full movement cost of crossing the river!
Non-domestic units may deboard but lose all moves (except Marines.)

Moves needed to cross a river to a tile on the other side:
6/3 moves: No infrastructure. (2.00 MP)
4/3 moves: Quay connected to roads. (1.33 MP)
2/3 moves: Bridge connected to roads. (0.67 MP)

• Built by issuing a "Build Quay" order (<b>Q</b>).
Requirements to build:

Highways are twice as fast as roads, using 1/6 move-point instead of 1/3. Motorized units actually move faster and farther on highways than railroads (36 vs 28 tiles). Other units double their range compared to a basic road. City centers automatically get Highways after you research Automobile tech.

<pre class='helptext'>Railroad tech lets you upgrade Roads to Railroads. Units use 1/28th of their full move_rate when using rails. This effectively gives all land units a range of 28 tiles when using rails. Non-allied units cannot use the movement bonus of a Railroad, but do gain the movement bonus of the Road that was built underneath it.

Railroads increase tile shield output by 50% (rounded down). A tile whose road is upgraded to rails retains the trade bonus from the road.

On tiles where you can build both Canals and Waterways, it’s better to build a Canal, since a Canal can serve as a water source for extending the length of your canal system. The rare exception would be if you didn’t want an enemy to be able to connect a Waterway into your canal system!
