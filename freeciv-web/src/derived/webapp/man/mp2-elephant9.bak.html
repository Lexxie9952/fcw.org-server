<h3 class='section'>Irrigation</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Irrigating a suitable tile causes it to produce extra food each turn. Most tiles yield +1 extra food. A desert river that does not already benefit from an oasis will yield +2, or +3 if it is a city on a desert river.


Irrigating a tile with a mine or oil well will destroy it.


City center tiles get their terrain irrigation bonus automatically, if there is no conflicting mine or oil well on the tile; however, this does not make cities count as a water source for further irrigation. Irrigation can be built on the city tile simply to allow irrigating elsewhere, but will not give the tile any further bonus except in the case of a desert river (see above.)

Build by issuing an "irrigate" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).

• Is a water source for Irrigation.

<div class='item' id='extra1'>
<h3 class='section'>Fishtrap</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Fishtraps become available with Refrigeration technology. Any Worker-type transported at sea can make one. A Fishtrap provides +2 food to its tile. Any Fish adjacent to the tile will also be raised by +2 food output and gain +1 trade. Fishtraps must be made adjacent to Fish, but cannot be made cardinally adjacent to each other. Nor can they be built directly on a tile
 with Fish, Whales, or a Buoy.

Build by issuing a "build base" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires Settlers or similar units.
• Requires Oceanic terrain on the tile.
• Prevented by Buoy on the tile.
• Prevented by Fish on the tile.
• Prevented by Whales on the tile.
• Prevented by Fishtrap on the tile or any cardinally adjacent tile.

<div class='item' id='extra2'>
<h3 class='section'>Mine</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Mines can be built on some types of terrain, which increases the number of production points produced by that tile. Hills get an extra 3 production points per tile; other terrains get 1 extra production point.


Building a mine on an irrigated tile will destroy the irrigation.

Build by issuing a "mine" order.

Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).

</pre>
</div>
<div class='item' id='extra3'>
<h3 class='section'>Oil Well</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Oil wells behave like mines (giving an extra production point), but require more technology. Oil wells can be built on Desert with knowledge of Construction, and on Arctic terrain with knowledge of Refining.


Building an oil well on an irrigated tile will destroy the irrigation.

Build by issuing a "mine" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires terrain with the "Oil" flag on the tile.

<div class='item' id='extra4'>
<h3 class='section'>Pollution</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Pollution appears on land tiles around cities with high production or population. It halves all output from its tile, and contributes to the risk of global warming.

The pollution can only be cleared by dispatching Workers, Settlers, or Engineers with the "clean pollution" order.

Pollution from production is likely to start becoming important as your civilization becomes more industrialized, giving you buildings such as Factory and Coal Plant which boost production. Replacing a Coal Plant with cleaner forms of energy — a Hydro Plant / Hoover Dam, Nuclear Plant, or Solar Plant — will reduce pollution from production, as will a Recycling Center or knowledge of Environmentalism.


The city population starts adding to pollution with the discovery of Industrialization, and Automobile, Mass Production, and Plastics make this worse. Building a Mass Transit in a city eliminates the populational contribution to pollution.


The contribution of these factors can be seen in the city dialog; once it exceeds a threshold, the excess is the percent chance of pollution appearing each turn.


When an unused tile becomes polluted, there is the temptation to avoid the effort of cleaning it; but the spread of pollution has far more terrible results than the immediate economic impact — every polluted tile increases the chance of global warming. Each time global warming advances, the entire world loses coastal land to the sea and to jungles and swamps, and inland tiles are lost to desert. This tends to devastate cities and leads to global impoverishment.


The risk of global warming is cumulative; the longer polluted tiles are left uncleaned, the higher the risk becomes, and the risk can linger for some time even after all pollution has been cleaned. If a long time passes with an elevated risk of warming, its effects will be all the more severe when it does occur.

May randomly appear around polluting city.

Can be cleaned by units (time is terrain-dependent).

<div class='item' id='extra5'>
<h3 class='section'>Hut</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Villages (also called "Huts") are primitive communities spread across the world at the beginning of the game. Any land unit can enter a village, making the village disappear and deliver a random response. If the village is friendly, the player could receive artifacts worth some gold, a map, a mercenary military unit with no upkeep, some bulbs, or even Goods or a Boat.


Later in the game, helicopters may also enter villages, but overflight by other aircraft will cause the villagers to take fright and disband.

Placed by map generator.
Can be explored by certain units.
Requires Land terrain on the tile.

</pre>
</div>
<div class='item' id='extra6'>
<h3 class='section'>Farmland</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Once Refrigeration is known, irrigation systems can be upgraded to Farmland by irrigating them a second time; if the city working the tile has a Supermarket, a Farmland tile provides twice as much food.


Like irrigation, Farmland is incompatible with mines and oil wells.

Build by issuing an "irrigate" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires knowledge of the technology Refrigeration.
• Requires Irrigation on the tile.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).

• Is a water source for Irrigation.
</pre>
</div>
<div class='item' id='extra7'>
<h3 class='section'>Fallout</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Nuclear Fallout can appear on land tiles when a Nuclear unit is detonated. It halves all output from its tile.


Every tile with Fallout also increases the risk of global nuclear winter. If nuclear winter occurs, land across the globe changes to colder terrain.


Worker types can clean Fallout. Fallout disperses and disappears randomly over time. On average, it lasts for about 6 turns.


May randomly appear around nuclear blast.

Can be cleaned by units (time is terrain-dependent).

</pre>
</div>
<div class='item' id='extra8'>
<h3 class='section'>Hideout</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Since the dawn of time, concealed terrain was used for Hideouts, to evade aggressors or set ambushes. Hideouts can be made by Foot Soldiers in Forests, Swamps, Mountains, and Jungle. Warrior Code must be known. Tile must be Friendly or Unclaimed. Only Land units and Helicopters are hidden. Other units are seen. Units inside are immune to killstack. Hideouts can’t exist with other bases. For each turn it is unoccupied, a Hideout has a 15% chance of disappearing, unless built on ruins. The only way to know if a tile has a Hideout is to have a Land unit inside.


Be careful! An abandoned Hideout can be used against you!

Build by issuing a "build base" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires that the server setting hideouts is enabled.
• Requires Warriors or similar units.
• Does not apply to Emissary, Diplomat, Spy, or Patriarch.

<div class='item' id='extra9'>
<h3 class='section'>Depth</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>In Deep Ocean, modern submarines can dive deep to be undetected. “Building Depth” affects the tile so all Submarine class units are hidden to adjacent units! They can still be attacked, but can’t be discovered unless moving into the tile. A Missile Submarine is required to “Build Depth”; other subs on the tile will join it at depth. The tile can’t have a Buoy or Fishtrap. The depth associated to the tile remains if any submarines are on it at turn change. A submarine may leave and return, automatically achieving depth on arrival.

Build by issuing a "build base" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires Missile Submarine.
• Requires Deep Ocean on the tile.
• Prevented by Buoy on the tile.
• Prevented by Fishtrap on the tile.

<div class='item' id='extra10'>
<h3 class='section'>Tile Claim</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>A Tile Claim asserts sovereignty over a tile. Tile Claims can be made in domestic territory with a single diplomatic unit. Non-domestic territory requires adjacency to an existing Tile Claim, and the Diplomat must be supported by another unit. Claiming foreign tiles gives casus belli. If a claimed tile is unoccupied, foreign units entering the tile will take possession of it for their own nation, also giving casus belli.

Build by issuing a "build base" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires Emissary, Diplomat, Spy, or Patriarch.
• Does not apply to Warriors or similar units.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.

Can be pillaged by units (takes 1 turn).

<h3 class='section'>Quay</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Quays improve logistics on rivers. River and Canal traffic can deboard to a quay for 1⁄₃ move instead of disembarking for full moves onto adjacent tiles (domestic units only.) Quays let units ferry across rivers——the ancient way to cross without a bridge! Moving from road-to-quay or quay-to-road uses 2⁄₃ move point. Quays can also be put on Canals. In cities they allow moving to adjacent roads for only 1⁄₃ move. Quays are RestrictedInfra. Only allied units can use them to cross rivers, and only domestic units can use them to deboard at 1⁄₃ move. Non-domestic units may deboard but lose all moves (except Marines.)

Don’t make too many Quays. The ability to unload on rivers helps enemies do surprise attacks.

Moves needed to cross a river to a tile on the other side:
⁶⁄₃ moves: No infrastructure.
⁴⁄₃ moves: Quay connected to roads.
2⁄₃ moves: Bridge connected to roads.


Build by issuing a "road" order.
Requirements to build:

<h3 class='section'>Railroad</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Railroad tech lets you upgrade Roads to Railroads. Units use 1/28th of their full move_rate when using rails. This effectively gives all land units a range of 28 tiles when using rails.

Railroads increase tile shield output by 50% (rounded down). A tile whose road is upgraded to rails retains the trade bonus from the road.

City center tiles are automatically upgraded with railroads when you acquire Railroad technology.

<h3 class='section'>River</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>A River adds +1 trade to the output of a tile, and +0.50 to the terrain defense bonus. Units with full move points can move 8 tiles along a River, regardless of their move rate. That is, units use 1/8th of their full move rate on each river tile.
In enemy territory, crossing a river is difficult. If there is no bridge,  stepping onto or off of a river expends full move points. In your own  territory, your people have intimate knowledge of where the better crossing  points are, in order to avoid this penalty.


Roads can be built on rivers after you acquire Bridge Building technology. On Flatland, this gives an additional +1 trade on top of the trade bonus from the river.

<h3 class='section'>Mountain River</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>A Mountain River is a river on a mountain. Land units who can't go on Mountains cannot go on Mountain Rivers.


A River adds +1 trade to the output of a tile, and +0.50 to the terrain defense bonus. Units with full move points can move 8 tiles along a River, regardless of their move rate. That is, units use 1/8th of their full move rate on each river tile.
In enemy territory, crossing a river is difficult. If there is no bridge,  stepping onto or off of a river expends full move points. In your own  territory, your people have intimate knowledge of where the better crossing  points are, in order to avoid this penalty.


Roads can be built on rivers after you acquire Bridge Building technology. On Flatland, this gives an additional +1 trade on top of the trade bonus from the river.

Build by issuing a "road" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires terrain with the "CanHaveRiver" flag on the tile.
• Requires Mountains on the tile.
• Prevented by knowledge of the technology Pottery.
• Prevented by knowledge of the technology Alphabet.

Requirements to build:
• Requires Oceanic terrain on the tile.
• Requires Land terrain on the tile or a cardinally adjacent tile.
• Requires knowledge of the technology Steel.
• Requires Settlers or similar units.

<h3 class='section'>Walls</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>If you own the Great Wall, Walls can be built on land not held by a foreign nation. Walls can’t be built on Mountains, Swamp, Rivers, or Bases. Domestic units on the Walls get a free defense bonus of 1.5×. When fortified, 2.25×. In foreign territory, non-allied land units lose all moves when entering or exiting a tile occupied by Walls. Foreign units caught on Walls with no move points are considered vulnerable from climbing and scaling, and suffer a -50% defense penalty.

Build by issuing a "road" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires Land terrain on the tile.
• Prevented by Mountains on the tile.
• Prevented by Swamp on the tile.

<h3 class='section'>Canal</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Canals are a canal-type allowing all ships to travel over land tiles. They provide the same move bonus to land units as a River does. Canals can be built on Lowlands only. They require an Ocean or Lake as an adjacent water source.
* A Waterway is a second canal-type that can use ocean-sourced Canals and Rivers as a water source.
All canal-types enable Irrigation and Quays, but give no tile output bonus.

Build by issuing a "road" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires terrain with the "Low Land" flag on the tile.
• Requires Oceanic terrain on the tile or a cardinally adjacent tile.
• Requires knowledge of the technology Engineering.
• Requires Settlers or similar units.

<h3 class='section'>Waterway</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Waterways are an inland canal-type. They’re the same as a Canal, but can use Rivers and ocean-sourced Canals as their water source. Unlike a Canal, however, they can’t serve as a water source for any canal-types. However, Waterways allow for dredging a river into a full-length canal system able to accomodate modern naval ships.
On tiles where you can build both Canals and Waterways, it’s better to build a Canal, since a Canal can serve as a water source for extending the length of your canal system. The rare exception would be if you didn’t want an enemy to be able to connect a Waterway into your canal system!

Build by issuing a "road" order.
Requirements to build:
• Requires terrain with the "Low Land" flag on the tile.
