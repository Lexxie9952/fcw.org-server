  Tribesmen can explore, moving over terrain with no penalty. They don’t obey or exert ZOC. They work tiles at half the rate of Workers. They have a 3× bonus at hunting wild animals, and defend at 2× against them. 
  Tribesmen can make basic diplomatic contact and freely Investigate cities. They can carry Goods and enter nations with whom you are at Peace. They can do primitive combat—they can’t conquer cities and only fight 10 combat rounds. 
  Tribesmen help build nations by recycling into city production with a 2× bonus, donating their life-work to any output except units. ** Changing production target loses their work! **
  Tribesmen start with bonuses they lose as you become more civilized. For the first three turns they get a +⅓ move bonus. After 2500BC (T15), Tribesmen get old: they lose -⅓ move, see less, lose the recycle bonus, and can no longer work tiles.

Rumble attacks are meant to push and unsettle the enemy to stop them from fortifying into a tactical position. The action goes for 3 rounds of combat, uses 5/9 of a move point, and does not alter the fortified status of the Phalanx.

Falconets are huge and heavy. They have woeful accuracy but lethal firepower：they either kill or totally miss. On paper, attack odds are closest to a Musketeer (A3). Yet there is a high chance of losing when a win is expected, or winning when a loss is expected. The outcome is in God's hands! Falconeers defend a bit worse than they attack.
Righteous faith is needed to fight with slow heavy inaccurate weaponry: only Theocracies can train Falconeers. Other governments will incur high upkeep or see them retire.
