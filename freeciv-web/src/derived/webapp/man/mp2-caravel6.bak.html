<h3 class='section'>Anarchy</h3>

<pre class='helptext'>Anarchy is simply the absence of any recognizable government. Citizens are disorganized and unproductive, and will spend all income as quickly as possible, rather than paying taxes or conducting research. Under Anarchy, tiles suffer a -1 tile output penalty if they produce 3 or more of any resource.

Anarchy offers slightly less corruption than Despotism, but slightly more unhappiness.

Celebrating cities cannot rapture.
No citizens are made unhappy by each aggressive unit.
25% Base corruption in cities
2% Extra corruption per each tile in distance from capital
