; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first 
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Seafaring),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.

; "GameLoss"	= losing one of these units means you lose the game, but it
;		  is produced without homecity and upkeep
; "EvacuateFirst" = the game will try to rescue units with this flag before
;                 it tries to rescue units without it when their transport

; "NoHome"	= this unit has no homecity and will be free of all upkeep, and

Wagons are special Commerce units that can be made in the city that built the Appian Way.\
 Read the help on Caravans to see what Commerce units can do.\n\n\
Wagons are the first Land unit that can do Commerce; but they pay gold upkeep, cannot defend,\
 cannot fortify, and can only travel on roads. The main benefit of Wagons\
 is to transport slower units and reach distant cities faster.\n\n\
Units with 2 moves or less can be carried on Wagons. Only Foot units can\
 load/unload outside a city, but may lose their moves doing so.\n\n\
