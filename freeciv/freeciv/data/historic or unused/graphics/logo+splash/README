I hearby place my work under the GPL, (General Public License).  The following should also be noted:
The globe image "earth_cutout.png" is a derivative of a Public Domain image obtained from NASA.  This image
is used to texture the globe.
The map strip used in the splash screens is also a derivative of a PD NASA image.

NOTE: It is necessary to keep the file "earth_cutout.png" in the same directory as the file "Freeciv_Logo.svg",
otherwise you will get a "broken image" error in Inkscape.

Happy Freeciv'ing :-)
