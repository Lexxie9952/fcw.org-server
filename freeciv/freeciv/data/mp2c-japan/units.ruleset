; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first 
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Map Making),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.

;                          Effectively increases defense by value percent.

; ** Flags **
;
; "IgZOC"       = ignore Zones of Control (ZOC) even if unit class has
;                 "ZOC" flag
; "HasNoZOC"	  = unit has no Zone of Control (ZOC), thus any unit can move
;		              around it freely
; "NonMil"	    = a non-military unit：no martial law; can enter
;                 peaceful borders; DoesntOccupyTile
; "IgTer"       = use constant move cost defined in igter_cost (terrain.ruleset)
;                 rather than terrain/road etc cost, unless terrain cost is
;                 less
; "OneAttack"	  = can only make a single attack, regardless of movement points
; "FieldUnit"	  = cause unhappiness even when not being aggressive
; "BeachLander" = won't lose all its movement when moving from non-native
;                 terrain to native terrain even if slow_invasions is on.
; "Settlers"	  = "can irrigate and build roads" but really seems to be a required flag for

; "Diplomat"	  = can defend against diplomat actions (see diplchance
;                 server option)

;                 unit class can
; "Cant_Fortify"= cannot fortify even if unit class has "CanFortify" flag
; "Fanatic"	    = can only be built by governments that allow them
;		              (see civ2/governments.ruleset, Fvndamentalist government)
; "Unique"	    = a player can only have one of these units in the game at
;		              the same time; barbarians cannot use this at present
; "GameLoss"	  = losing one of these units means you lose the game, but it
;		              is produced without homecity and upkeep
; "EvacuateFirst"=the game will try to rescue units with this flag before
;                 it tries to rescue units without it when their transport
;                 is destroyed. Think of the Birkenhead drill ("women and
;                 children first"). Replace "women and children" with
;                 "units with the EvacuateFirst unit type flag".
; "SuperSpy"	  = this unit always wins diplomatic contests, that is, unless
;		              it encounters another SuperSpy, in which case defender wins;
;		              can also be used on non-diplomat units, in which case it can
;		              protect cities from diplomats; also 100% spy survival chance
; "NoHome"	    = this unit has no homecity and will be free of all upkeep, and
;		              therefore will not revolt along with its city of origin should
;		              it be incited
; "NoVeteran"   = this unit cannot gain veteran levels through experience
;                 (as if both raise_chance and work_raise_chance were zero);

; "NoBuild"     = this unit cannot be built
; "BadWallAttacker"=the firepower of this unit is set to 1 if attacking a city

; "BadCityDefender"=if attacked while in a city, firepower is set to 1
;		              and firepower of attacker is doubled (the Pearl Harbour rule)
; "BarbarianOnly" = only barbarians can build this unit
; "Shield2Gold" = Switch from shield upkeep to gold upkeep possible.
; "NewCityGamesOnly" = unit can't be built on scenarios where founding new cities
;                 is not allowed. Give this flag to units that would make no sense
;                 to have in a game with such a scenario
; "CanEscape"   = this unit has, given that certain conditions are
;                 fulfilled, a 50% chance to escape rather than being
;                 killed when killstack is enabled and the defender of its
;                 tile is defeated. The conditions are that it has more move
;                 points than required to move to an adjacent tile plus the
;                 attackers move points and that the attacker doesn't have
;                 the "CanKillEscaping" unit type flag.
; "CanKillEscaping" = an attack from this unit ignores the "CanEscape" unit
;                 type flag.
; "Provoking" =   Under autoattack_style=1 which this ruleset uses, only 
;                 Fighter types will autoattack and will ONLY attack units
;                 marked with the Provoking flag.  If overridden to autoattack_style=0,
;                 a unit considering to auto attack this unit will choose to
;                 do so even if has better odds when defending against it
;                 then when attacking it. Applies when the autoattack server
;                 setting is enabled.
; "NeverProtects" = doesn't protect reachable units on its tile from enemy
;                 attackers, even if the unreachableprotects server setting
;                 is enabled and the unit class is unreachable
; "NeverBlocked" = isn't blocked by unreachable units on targeted tile,
;                  even if the unreachableprotects server setting
;                  is enabled and the unit class is unreachable
; "MultiSlot"    = if server setting slot_control is ON, only unit types with this
;                  flag can use extra city_build_slots
; "TransportDefender" = Unit can always defend while transported, even on non-native
;                  terrain.
; "SentryAlways" = This unit always reports sentry-type information; give this flag to 
;                  reconnaissance/scouting type units who can't sentry because they are 
;                  fuel-type units (which can only sentry on refueling tiles.)
; "AvidAttacker" = Units under activity Vigil with this flag auto-attack everything  
;                  except "NonProvoking" units, (rather than only attacking
;                  units with the "Provoking" flag) (assuming autoattackstyle=1)  
; "NoStackDeath" = When in a stack whose defender is killed, this unit survives and 
;                  remains occupying the same tile. 
; "Reserved3"     = reserved for future use.
