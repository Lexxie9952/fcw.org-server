<u>History</u>
Classic+ is a refresh of Classic to incorporate years of experience, as well as advances and features in Freeciv development.

The original Classic ruleset has a long history. It started before Civilization II&trade; came out. After Civ2, Classic became a synthesis of three things. Civilization I, which it was built from, new features from Civilization II&trade; that were better, a few improvements from other Civ3, and a touch of salt and spice. The result is a Classic Civilization experience that is more "classic" than any of the original gamesâ€”in some people's view at least! 

Classic+ starts with Classic and stays true to its spirit, with some better graphics, sounds, bug fixes, units, and some fun new features.

After getting your feet wet with Classic+, you are encouraged to try more modern rulesets, such as:

Multiplayer+ - Like Classic, but with refinements and balance changes so that it functions well even in massive multiplayer human conditions.

Multiplayer II Evolution (MP2) - The cutting edge and ultimate synthesis of Classic Civilization with modern features and advancements. All the best classical mechanics are kept, and only the best newer features and units are added. This preserves the hard-edged chess match of older Civ with finer balance and large portfolio of new features, units, and improvements.
