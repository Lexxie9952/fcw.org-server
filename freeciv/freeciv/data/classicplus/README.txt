<u>History</u>
Classic+ is a refresh of the original Classic, which is an intelligently selected mix of 15% Civ1, 80% Civ2, and 5% Civ3. The result is more "classic" than any of the original gamesâ€”in some people's view! Classic+ stays true to its spirit, with upgrades. After getting your feet wet with Classic+, you are encouraged to take the jump into competitive Freeciv with <b><a href="https://freeciv.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer_II_Navigation_Page" target="_blank">MP2 rules</a></b>, starting at MP2.1 Avant-garde.
