<u>History</u>
Classic+ is a refresh of the original Classic ruleset to incorporate years of experience, and advances and features in Freeciv development.
The original Classic ruleset started before Civilization II&trade; came out. After Civ2, Classic became a synthesis of three things. Civ1, which it was built from, new features from Civ2; that were better, very few big improvements from Civ3, and a touch of salt and spice. The result is a Classic Civilization experience that is more "classic" than any of the original games—in some people's view at least! 
Classic+ starts with Classic and stays true to its spirit, with some better graphics, sounds, bug fixes, units, and some fun new features. Since Classic+ has to stay true to original Classic, the extra features are intended more as a transition and gateway drug into the world of MP2 rulesets.
After getting your feet wet with Classic+, you are encouraged to try more modern rulesets.
