; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the

; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more

; MAPGEN terrain deployment method:  ZONES, PARAMETERS. VALUES.
; 1. ZONES are pre-decided definitions of regions over the map.
;    ZONES are: flat, high elevation, wet, etc.
; ZONES then get a random terrain on each tile according to the logic of a tri-partite PARAMETER system:
; PARAMETERS are:   TARGET, PREFERRED, AVOID. PARAMETERS take VALUES which are:
; VALUES:  MG_TEMPERATE, MG_GREEN, MG_MOUNTAINOUS, i.o.w., the percentages given by property_temperate, etc., in terrain items defined in ruleset.
; Each parameter has a special logic.
; TARGET = all terrains with the passed PARAMTER property will be considered and one will be picked at random based on the % values for each terrain.
; PREFERRED =  only terrains with (some of) that property will be chosen.
; AVOID = all terrains with any of that property will be blacklisted from appearing in this ZONE.
;
; ZONES are:
;  Plains:  MG_TEMPERATE, MG_GREEN, MG_MOUNTAINOUS.

Waterway into your canal system!\

;                              higher move cost. In other words, the same as
;                              how roads work with railroads.

;                            for this road is only incurred by unfriendly invader units.
;                            This flag allows you to create "terrain obstacle" extras that
;                            slow enemy movement (including IGTER units) when the extra
;                            is encountered by an unfriendly unit on non-allied foreign
;                            territory.
;   - "PassiveMovement"   = The move cost on this terrain comes from a passive infra
;                           source; e.g., rivers cost less move_frags because of
;                           boats on which the actor unit becomes a PASSIVE passenger.
;                           in other words move_cost is a divisor of the actor unit's
;                           move_rate. This means that the "move_cost" value really
;                           reflects the max moves any unit can make while "passively"
;                           using it. This solves age-old problem of the trains and boats
;                           that horsemen used, being twice as fast as for warriors.
