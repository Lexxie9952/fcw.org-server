; Bombs are complicated. They have zero move cost to load, which is necessary to allow them to load up and be used
; on the turn they're created. They have a double move cost for unload, which evens it out to prevent double-hauling
; them across the planet for a distant bombing mission. PROBLEM IS: "Transport Board" allows loading while already
; transported in the other actionenablers. And we don't want it to or it would be nightmare micromanaged
; deboard-first-now-board extra keystrokes all over the place and a rethinking of all our move costs for such things.
; However, for Bombs only, by charging nothing to board, double-charging deboarding, and disallowing boarding while
; transported, everything works out peachy. You can double-haul any bomb but not use it this turn. You can single-haul
; a conventional bomb and use it this turn (with no tired attack because conv.Bombs don't have it), you can single-haul a
; nuclear bomb and use it this turn. You can load either, on the turn it's made, onto a Bomber and be ready for action
; at full moves.

;always be able to board to save themselves from drowning.
;
;The two enablers below catch a bug in complex rulesets that have complex Boarding rules.
;The bug is that a unit doing order_move or order_perform_action "transport embark" to a
;transport on a non-native tile, are allowed to move to that tile because embark is legal.
;But then the movepoints are subtracted first, and then because it has no moves left, it
;no longer fulfills the legality for Embark action, leaving it stranded on the water.
;The logic then seems to fall thru to check if "Transport Board" would be legal and it
;tries that next, but if the ruleset has complex rules for "Transport Board" and that's also
;no longer legal, the unit can't board in order to pull off the verisimilitude of doing
;an embark. Apparently it assumed or was only tested with rulesets with legacy rules
;of zero moves_left being allowed for Boarding. Ideally we'd debug this logic on the
;server to see where it's slipping over itself and ALLOWING the move BECAUSE
;embark is legal then NOT allowing the embarcation to actually happen because it does
;the move, loses move points, then lost the legality to embark/board and becomes
;stranded in the water. For now, we are making two ruleset enablers to allow faulty
;server logic to work, where a unit that would obviously be stranded in the water
;is allowed to perform the server's fallthru logic of doing a Boarding action.
;This also allows any other bugged units floating in water to Board and get picked
;up by ships coming by, should that ever happen for other reasons.
