Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
 
   What motivates Ruleset additions
      
Focus goals for MP2-Dragoon
  Simplify unnecessary complexities.
  Boost early game action, growth.
  Rebalance governments, mostly through finer mathematical control of population growth.
  Project Neptune, improve sea.

I. Simplification:
================================================================================================================
1. Goods are now available with Pottery and cost 20. Can now
help build wonders. Recycle penalty reduced to 3 shields. 
The tech, cost, wonder, and recycle changes allow Goods to
to fulfill their purpose of enhancing early game depth and
richness.
============================================================
2. "Advisor" for buildings suggests an order similar to 
   an experienced player, instead of alphabetic.
============================================================
3. QUAY upgrades
   a. Quay-to-Road and Road-to-Quay uses 2/3 move point. (was 1/3, 3/3)
   b. Exiting a city with a quay remains 1/3 move point  (was 1/3)
   c. Time to build Quay is now 1 worker-turn: encourage ancient river importance.
   d. Exiting quay now being 2/3 instead of 1/3 or 1/9 (rail), reduces territorial 
      risk of making quays, somewhat.
   A new server feature simplifies this. <ADD TO: SIMPLIFIERS>
=============================================================
4. No sea commerce units cause unhappiness, for consistency
   and simplification.
=============================================================
5. City Walls are 2x defense like all other defense-types.
Fixes a confusion where 3x was wrongly attributed because it
was customary to consider City Walls as 3x because the free-
fortify bonus of 1.5x means the total bonus of defenders in
cities with walls was 3x. However, this resulted in the 
free-fortify bonus being multiplied twice for units in 
cities with walls, creating 4.5x. The result of this mistake
made some dramatic changes to gameplay:
-the ability to rapid-buy walls in an emergency for chokepoint
cities for 4.5x instead of 3x meant the game became skewed to
not needing to buy as many military units, and thus 
more heavily economic until post-gunpowder heavy 
weaponry was discovered.
-greatly force-multiplied the strategic dynamics of
"playing sim city while gunpowder rushing"
-took away from bronze age and iron age warfare
-made the game heavily "aerocentric" since SAM Batteries 
are only 2x defense (instead of 4.5x); this resulted in:
-"flight rushing" being force multiplied more than it should
-the "chess tactics" of ground warfare, zoc, positional
warfare, etc., being greatly reduced.
-land conquest and control of non-city terrestrial positions
and borders were greatly reduced and replaced with a game of
"city pounding"
-disrupted tactical integrity of the game.
==============================================================
6. City Fortifications cleaned and simplified.
Simply adds +0.33 to the terrain defense bonus 
(+0.50 for Flatland). Gets same +10 cost increase as 
City walls, after Metallurgy. All other iffy conditionals 
cleaned out and removed.
==============================================================
7. Capture and Expel both cost 2/3 move. (Was 1, 2/3)


II. Early game action
================================================================================================================
1. Granary Size, Population Changes:
            S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10
MP2C:       20  30  40  50  60  70  70  70  70...
ttg @+2     10  15  20  25  30  35  35  35  35
pyramid      8  12  15  19  ...
granary     --   8  10  13
pyr+gran.   --   5   5   7

MP2D X2:    15  20  25  31  37  45  53  60  60...
ttg @+2      8  10  13  16  19  22  27  30  30
pyramid      8  12  15  19  ...
granary     --   8  10  13
pyr+gran.   --   5   5   7

This speeds the early game with a tightly controlled 
mathematical solution: a sweet spot to accelerate the foodbox
without bad side effects on the proportional balance of other
game elements. Speeding up the foodbox has been tried by
others for a long time, but with "mathematically diseased side
effects". This simple solution is a magic formula for 
preserving the magic of the original classical balance. 
This change does more than just that. It simultaneously
improves 2 flaws in the Discrete Mathematics of the system.
Those flaws heavily discouraged size 3 cities under Despotism,
and discouraged making new cities for the last 40%
of the game. Those phenomena are now softened.
Mathematical processing of 3 other models from X1 to X4,
mildest to extreme, were also balanced. X2 as the middle
was chosen for main default mp2d rules.

In addition it continues quantitative balancing for governments
not rapturing.
============================================================
2. Mountain Goats (3 1 0) & Hippopotami (3 1 0), more food
for early growth, more balance for desert/mountain terrain
============================================================
3. Under Despotism, All new cities get +2 food when
   founded (+4 for capital).
   ...
   Scarcity and hard survivalism both under despotism and 
   resourcefulness of nomadic ways, resulted in people
   hoarding preserved food sources.
   1. This reduces the early game "slow period" by about 1 turn.
   2. It furthers the project of quantitative easing against the
   forcing-effect of "leave Despotism for Monarchy ASAP".
   Gradually people will wake up into realising a multiplicity
   of Bronze Age diversity exists. 
============================================================
4. With Pyramids, cities start with 33% or +5 food for 5/15.
   (MP2C was: 25% or 5/20.).
   This compensates the increase in Pyramids cost and the
   higher science requirements. Pyramid strategies will be
   more interesting.
   Cost: 180 (was 200)
   Gives its city a rapture rate of 100% regardless of gov.
============================================================
5. Ziggurat 
   was least popular Tribe Wonder:
      no economic bonus except from relocating capital;
   NOW:
      * shield output has no tile penalties
      * +1 food on city centre, Settlers have no food upkeep
      * no longer requires river
==============================================================
6. Nomadism / Early game balance bonuses 
During the first 5 turns, each Settler gets 1 bulb/turn; this
represents the fact that nomads can learn things too, and
causes less penalty for players in bad starting position 
who must migrate to decent starting position.
==============================================================
7. Latejoin gold is 14/turn instead of 13, as early game is
somewhat faster in mp2d

III. Rebalance governments, mostly through finer mathematical control of population growth.
================================================================================================================
1. Rapture Rate is here. Allows most govs to participate in
   it at different rates; which allows finer balancing of 
   the govs to make them more usable and interesting.

Communism                  40  40  40  40  40  40  40  40
==============================================================
2. Nationalism is +20% sci in original cities
    balances that -15% is global for lux 
==============================================================
3. Ecclesiastical Palace, cost:70 (was 90). (same as Palace)
   Now allows instant switching to Theocracy with no anarchy
   or revolution delay (if you have Theocracy)
==============================================================
4. Theology gives blueprints for Theocracy.
==============================================================
5. Theocracies can make the Patriarch unique unit, which is a
diplomatic unit that bribes and incites at 1/3 the cost.
==============================================================
6. Zealots can change home city to a foreign ally who is 
 Theocratic. This allows more fluid strategies of bringing 
 all Zealots to fight together under the same command, and
 even for former Theocracies to re-home Zealots into allied
 Theocracies in order to avoid the double-unhappiness
 upkeep which Zealots suffer when not under Theocracy.
==============================================================
7. Theocracy can incite other cities at a 33% discount.
==============================================================
8. Theocracy corruption changed from 2% + 2% per tile to 
 0% + 1% per tile.
==============================================================
9. Theocracy gets a free +1 happy per city.
==============================================================
10. Communism: celebrating cities with granaries get +1 food
to city tile.
==============================================================
11. Communism gets +40% capital prod bonus
==============================================================
12. New wonder: Commissariat of Agriculture: +5 starting food
in each city. Work-rate for Farmland is 2 worker-turns, not 3.
+10% gross food output per city.
==============================================================
13. Communist cities get the effects of a free Supermarket.
==============================================================
14. Communism completely unaffected by empire size/# cities 
(was 12, then none)
==============================================================
15. Communism +1 trade on irrigated tiles that produce trade.
==============================================================
16. Police Station does +2 forced content under authoritarian
    govs. No longer does +1 make_content_mil under nationalism
==============================================================
17. Angkor Wat reduces city celebration size from 3 to 2.
    Angkor Wat now also works for Theocracy government.
==============================================================
18. New wonder: Propaganda Ministry, +1 happy +2 lux for 
authoritarian governments.
==============================================================
19. Monarchy, CM, Theocracy: 1 free gold upkeep on units.
Communism: 3 free gold upkeep on units.


IV. Units*
================================================================================================================
1. Partisans can investigate conquered cities not owned 
   by the original owner. Partisans join the sentry always
   class of units. Partisans gain +2/9 moves per veteran
   level. Partisans also gain whatever vet level effects
   are operative from Barracks or wonders (all rulesets).
============================================================
2. Riflemen and Alpines upgrade to Ground Troops
      * cost is only 4 gold.
=============================================================
3. Explorer changed to Scout. Available with Horseback Riding,
   moves 4 tiles (6 with Map Making, which makes it identical
   to the Explorer.) Cost reduced 2 shields to be the same 
   as Horseme. Gains +2/9 move per veteran level.
=============================================================
4. AAA re-balance and Mobile SAM rebalance/simplify.
   ...
   * AAA are an integral part of ground infantry forces so 
    get gold upkeep instead of shield upkeep. Compensates
    some losses to this unit:
   * In other respects AAA are no longer like Marines who
     attack while transported or BeachLander moves, but
     are same as any other ballistic unit. Still retain 
     ability to attack non-native tiles.
   * AAA need 9 turns of service + 3 turns to convert to M.Sam
    (was 10 + 4).
   * Upgrades to Mobile SAM like any other unit (simplicity)
5. Mobile SAM
   * Mobile SAMs 2x defense now also against Missile units
   * Can now carry two missiles (was 1)
   * Can now attack non-native tiles like AAA
   * After discovery of Laser, Mobile SAMS provide a 33% chance
     of defending all units on their tile from a nuclear blast.
   * Mobile SAM convert from AAA in 3 turns after 9 turns of 
     service and the order can be done in any domestic city.
     (was: 10, capital city)
=============================================================
6. Armor II bonus vs. Missiles cut to 50% (was 100% i.e. 2x)
this buffs the little used Mobile SAM to more usefulness in
tactical operations and nerfs the Armor II which was getting 
too much use as an anti-cruise missile defender unit instead 
of its intended purpose.
7. Zeppelin 7 moves, 7 turns of fuel.  More realistic and
 provides more possible use for this special unit.
=============================================================
8. Jet fighter types, upgrades
Were underpowered relative to other units.

A:D ratio of jets:mech.inf is now only slightly less than
A:D fighters:alpines (was substantially less, at a time when
    SAM Battery becomes available to make it even worse.)

Stealth Fighter
   A9 D6 Cost:85 was A8 D4.
Jet Fighter
   A7 D6, was A6 D5. (better defender than escort fighter)
Ground Strike Fighter
   A8 D5, was A7 D4

Multirole Fighter, upgrades Escort Fighter
   A6 D7 two turns fuel. Cost: 90
   Range fighter
=============================================================
9. SentryAlways 
		scout, balloon, zeppelin, e.fighter, m.fighter, 
      partisan, awacs, spy plane, satellite
==============================================================
10. Boats 8hp - Triremes and Warriors can beat them; similar
   to what was done with Workers/Tribesmen.
==============================================================
11. Diplomatic Units 
   Emissary - early diplomat, costs 24 (was 26), cannot sabotage cities, moves 3
   Diplomat - req:Economics, costs 30 (was 26), can establish embassy without spent
   Spy - can no longer establish embassy. Emissaries upgrade to Diplomats for free.

   Results:
   (1) Reduced cost with less speed and ability to sabotage,
       is more appreciated for early game use and balance.
   (2) Siege Ram needed for taking out city walls, makes the
       unit more purposeful.
   (3) Ability to establish multiple embassies for slightly
       higher cost, is more appreciated around the time the
       Diplomat now becomes availiable; improves globalness
       of the game.
   (4) Inability for Spy to make hostile embassy (especially
       having 6 moves), repurposes the unit better for
       espionage, decreases OPness, and increases game
       depth and intrigue in having multiple types of 
       diplomatic units.
==============================================================
12. All Ballistic type units can now SUA iff they haven't 
moved; are also able to SUA against oceanic tiles (if not
trasported.)
==============================================================
13. Trawlers are work-boats that can do Fishtraps, Buoys,
 Roads, Quays, Canals, Sea Bridges, & clean pollution/fallout.
 Trawlers can carry one Land unit, usually Engineers or 
 Workers, to expedite their water work. Trawlers can tow ships 
 at a reduced rate of -3 move points. Towing gets damaged
 ships back to port for repair and helps crew repair rates 
 if the damaged is resting while towed. If a Trawler stops
 towing it recovers pro-rated move points.
==============================================================
14. Ballista unit, new tactical use type of unit
==============================================================
15. Ballistic sub-class of units can vigil if in a city or
base of any type. They auto-bombard instead of auto-attack,
based on if they have a higher probability of winning a 
standard attack. Unlike air interception, they only target
non-civilian military units.
This relieves some issues vis-a-vis unfair camping advantages,
by letting people who aren't on all the time to set up 
retaliatory defense structures in some areas. Also gives 
is a balance adjustment for weaker city walls.
==============================================================
16. New unit Magnum Turret, unique unit.
==============================================================
17. Freight can use multiple build slots, like Infantry.
=============================================================
18. Legion price adjust 30 (was 32) - got 20% discount like 
   all other foot units, off the classic price, but it was
   overpriced in classic.
==============================================================
19. Helicopters types gain half hp first turn arriving and
staying in city: (hp is  "half" like a kind of fuel, and "half"
the amount of damage it got.) This rightly sets healing to 1 turn
for short sortie, 2 turns for damaged <50%, and 3 turns for badly
damaged if there's no airport.
==============================================================
20. Abilities of Marines and AAA were cleaned up and clarified
in better documentation. 
==============================================================
21. Freight moved to the Corporation - allows earlier use 
of Freight advantages at a time when they're more appropriate,
during the difficult ramp up of industrial revolution. Also,
the bonuses of the unit suit the represented technology.
==============================================================
22. Truck moved to Automobile, for obvious reasons, but also, 
this unit is quite powerful and was available too early 
(too hard to make wonders at this stage, allowed Marines on 
Trucks to make Cavalry less meaningful.)



V. Misc*
================================================================================================================
1. Mausoleum
   Effectively, upkeep on Courthouses is free.
   Courthouses cost 5 less; during Despotism, they cost the
     same as a temple.
============================================================
2. Hills Vision
   hills give half the vision bonus of mountains;
   (sees 4 more tiles instead of 8 [corner tiles]
============================================================
3. Agoge reduces Phalanx price 3 shields.
   Counts as a Barracks in its home city.
   +1 move bonus for starting turn in city now applies to
      all cities, not just Agoge city. 
   Increases chance of veteran promotion 50% for phalanxes
   (this is not +50% odds, it's +50% frequency), i.e:
   50 33 20 15 becomes 75 50 30 22
   Agoge + Barracks in a city allows making hardened Phalanxes
=============================================================
4. Techs and Costs:
   Monotheism 300 (384), Theology 400 (600), Theocracy 500 (725)
   Invention 490 (468), Democracy 950 (875), Banking 475 (364)
   Medicine 475 (468) Ironworking 65 (80). Philosophy 325 (276)
   Navigation 500 (485). University 450 (415). 
   Chemistry 900 (800)
   Astronomy, Feudalism, Trade, Republic 150 (145)

   Misc techs rounded to clean numbers. 
   Philosophy now gives a 70% blueprint instead of a full tech.
=============================================================
5. Zeus promotion bonus changed: instead of The Republic
   tech turning it off, it's Monotheism or Communism that
   turns off the bonus. The two different "make content"
   bonuses were clarified.
=============================================================
6. University Pre-req for Steam Engine changed to
   Magnetism. In most cases this will mean Frigates now
   come two techs before Ironclads; rather than possibly
   after.
=============================================================
7. Terrain Walls - The Great Wall wonder allows 
one to build walls right on the map. The terrain properties
are:
1. Takes one turn to build, set Tile target with (D)o
2. Takes four turns to pillage.
3. Can't be built on a Base, River, or Canal
4. Non-allied units lose all move points moving onto a wall,
and lose all move points moving off of a wall
5. Foreign units who are on a wall tile and have 
no moves left, are considered as 'attempting to scale the
wall' and in a vulnerable state, and have a -50% defense 
while caught on the wall with no moves left.
6. Domestic units on a wall are considered fortified for free,
even if not in a fortified state. (NB:not allies, yours only)
7. Can't be built on Mountains, Rivers, Bases.
8. Be careful, pillage time is 4 turns. 
=============================================================
8. Destroy City - Massacre a city (gives global casus belli)
Requires 2 units on tile, actor must be capturer-type.
Foreign city: destroyer gov mustn't be Demo, Theo; 
city size 2-8; 
Domestic city: only avail to Despo, Commie;
15% foreign, must use (D)o command. size 1-8;
==============================================================
9. Huts can now also give:
  * Small bulb awards (1-5 bulbs).
  * a Boat (if on a river)
  * Goods (if discovered by a unit who can carry Goods)
  * A map of the surrounding area (14 tile diameter)
==============================================================
10. EFT_REHOME_PCT alters the likelihood of units disbanding
    from conquered/razed cities based on gov type.
    Despotism:15,Monarchy:30,CM/Comm:45,Repub/Natl:60,
    Demo:75,Theo:90
==============================================================
11. Citadel of Aleppo - 3x defense impervious to ballistic
   units and siege ram. Allows each nation to make one 
   special fortress city with the same strength as old 
   city walls, to feel safe about it. Cost:120
==============================================================
12. Chand Baori - cost 65 (was 80)
==============================================================
13. Corruption reducing buildings and wonders will always be
guaranteed to reduce at least 1 corruption (if there is any).
This finally solves an age-old freeciv problem that came from
"double-truncation-rounding" error, which made corruption
reduction nearly worthless in small despotism cities
or medium monarchy cities; yet these are the exact contexts
when corruption loss as a percentage of GDP are at their 
worst and when the game can greatly benefit by an improvement
to help with corruption. 
Courthouse, Palace, Ecclesiastical Palace, Sphinx, Ziggurat,
Supreme Court, and Mausoleum of Mausolos will all reduce
a minimum of 1 corruption, if there is any corruption.
==============================================================
14. JTIDS cost 275 (was 230).
==============================================================
15. Small balance adjust to early starting techs, gives micro-
expansion of early bronze age strategic pathways, decreases
new-gov rush slightly. Most techs go to 22, masonry and
bronze working go to 20.
==============================================================
16. req #2 for Gunpowder changed from Iron Working to 
Feudalism (which needs Iron Working anyway)...fixes some
issues with tech tree flow.
==============================================================
17. No stack death takes place on ruins. Undocumented effect 
 that hideouts don't disappear in ruins is now documented.
==============================================================
18. Homeland Security prevents Poison City from taking place.
==============================================================
19. Bunkers have 90% chance to resist nuclear detonation.
i.e., units inside won't die.
==============================================================
20. If ending turn in a city and not qualified for any other
healing effect, a minimum +1 hp healing takes place. (e.g., 
no healing from barracks, being fortified, +1/3hp for staying
1 turn in city and not moving, or +10% for being on a tile
and not moving for a whole turn.)
==============================================================
21. Default blueprints is 65 (was 70)
    Default techleak is 50 (was 40)
Slight penalty for "technology gangs" and slightly more help
for those not in one. Note the slightly more bulbs needed 
at 65% blueprint is somewhat lessened by higher techleak. 

Techleak, when tallying the total number of players vs.
the number of players having a tech: doesn't count dead
players, Barbarian players, NewAvailablePlayers, and players
who are idle 5 or more turns.   
==============================================================
22. Fishtraps become available with Refrigeration technology.
 A Fishtrap provides +2 food to its tile. Any Fish adjacent to
 the tile will be raised to +6 food output and gain +1 trade.
 Fishtraps must be made adjacent to Fish, but cannot be made
 cardinally adjacent to each other. Nor can they be built
 directly on a tile with Fish, Whales, or a Buoy.
==============================================================
23. Except for Aircraft, Missiles, and Marines:
* the move cost to Deboard and Board is 1/3, likewise a Transport
  doing Load or Unload causes 1/3 move cost to all the units which
  that command causes to Deboard or Board. 
* the requirement to be able to Board (or Load a unit) is the
  cargo must have remaining moves left. This is not the case
  for Deboard/Unload (it lets a unit who spent its moves
  boarding, safely land at destination and transport to move
  on to other things.)
  
All the above is the current evolution of "balanced compromise"
to (1) reducing "double move" phenomena using mulitple load/unload
on multiple transports, while (2) at same time not excessively
slowing the longturn pace and aggravating the already
cumbersome transport logistics.
==============================================================
24. Copernicus costs 90 (was 100).
==============================================================
25. New feature, cargo on some types of transports is openly
visible. Current test case are Wagons and Trawlers.
==============================================================
26. Boarding a transport requires having moves left. This 
works in conjunction with the 1/3 move cost of boarding/deboarding 
for a limiting factor on double moving and transporter-swapping
==============================================================
27. Leonardo's Workshop is now never obsolete, but the
discovery of Robotics or Rocketry reduces the effect to 1
upgrade turn. Reasons: more quantitative easing on upgrade
retadation syndrome; reduce overly strong penalties on
discovery of automobile.
==============================================================
28. Colosseum costs 375
==============================================================
29. FORMERLY: courthouse/homeland/police/theocracy blocked 
diplomats from hostile embassy (needs ceasefire/peace first);
only police station/theocracy blocked hostile spies.
NOW: courthouse/homeland/police/theo blocks emissary and diplo;
only police/theo blocks diplo who has espionage tech
==============================================================
30. Combustion increases pollution 25% instead of Automobile:
the Leo/Sun Tzu/Colossus/Barracks II/Pollution quintuple
penalty was too excessive and one-pathed tech strategies.
==============================================================
31. Mass Transit moved to Combustion : realism, balance, and
playability. (Allow pollution reduction on the second pop.
polluting effect instead of third).
==============================================================
32. Power Plants, all are +30%, and +20% with Mass Prod.
Nuclear remains at +60% (automatic since one has Mass Prod.)
Hydro Upkeep reduced from 3 to 2. Hoover makes all Hydros 
act like Nuclear but still producing no extra pollution.
==============================================================
33. No stack death in hideouts; this helps give the hideout
more parity as a strategic option, compared to a Fort. Too
often, people wanting to make hideouts did not choose them 
because stack death made it always a worse choice than a fort 
which has a bonus defense AND no stack death.

1. MagLevs can only be built wherever railroads may be built,
(i.e. Road and SeaBridge). A railroad is not required. They
can't be built on ocean (unless SeaBridge.) Railroads take
1.5 worker-turns to complete, not 2; this can assist 
economic pace in some cases of never vet Workers and work
bonuses.
==============================================================
2. Battleships get same vision radius as Cruiser. 
==============================================================
3. Fix, Transport inaccurately documented as causing
   unhappiness. (Units with 0 Attack do not cause unhappy)
=============================================================
4. Adam Smith wonder adjusted back to 300 cost; the former 
   cost increase had been implemented before the WYSIWYG 
   upgrade, which now makes this wonder less OP and no
   longer justifying the cost increase.
=============================================================
5. Hideouts  
   temporary patch requirement for unit to be alone
   was fixed after a bug fix no longer requires this.
=============================================================
6. Tile Claims 
   Fixed a bug where tile claims were only cardinally adjacent
   Requirement for diplomat to be accompanied is only if not 
      in domestic territory.
   Can be now be made on any tile adjacent to existing claim.
   Conflict where Tile Claim can't be made in a base, was 
      fixed.
=============================================================
7. Cathedral costs 70 (was 75)
=============================================================
8. Fixed bug (also mp2c) where Airplane was not counted 
   as non-military and couldn't do diplomatic missions 
   to nations with whom you're at peace.
==============================================================
9. Theocracy spawns Zealots instead of Partisans 
==============================================================
10. Wild Animal hunting now gives food (for edible types).

Project Neptune 
================================================================================================================
1. Lighthouse never obsolete, but must be built before 
   Electricity. Movement bonus reduces to +1 when combined
   with Nuclear Power bonus. Magellan gives +1 move to 
   nations who don't have Lighthouse.
==============================================================
2. Missile carrying ships -- changes:
AEGIS can carry 5 (was 2)
Missile Destroyer can carry 2 (was 1)
Submarine can carry 0 (was 8)
Missile Submarine can carry 4 (new unit!)
==============================================================
3. Lighthouse and Magellan's Expedition get the Port Facility
effect of healing ships which stay in town for one full turn.
==============================================================
4. Submarine class loses 1 less move point than other units when 
attacking and succeeding. Submarine unit can no longer carry
missiles...
==============================================================
5. New unit Missile Submarine...can carry missiles and do 
"deep dive". 2 more hp and better defense also.
==============================================================
6. Crew Repair simplified: every type of ship gets 10% repair:
i.e., effectively +1 hp more than previously: providing a
slight buff to ship durability and usability, and bringing the
successfully tested crew repair to the ancient (wooden ships)
This combines with improved Lighthouse/Nuclear Power effects.
==============================================================
7. All ships gain +1 to their minimum speed when damaged:
Boat, Trireme, Riverships: 3 (was 2)
Submarines: 5 (was 4)
all other Sea Units: 4 (was 3)
==============================================================
8. Most ships gain +1 move. Adjusts a discrepancy between
their speed and that of corresponding land units using roads.
Ships to not gain +1 = Trireme, Longboat, Ram Ship
Frigate gets +2 (had received a +1 adjustment prior to all
ships getting a general +1). This changes also lessens 
the "molasses effect" in island games, where all sea-based 
operations are excessively slower than land operations.
==============================================================
9. Shore attacks for modern ships changed:
  • Battle will last 20 combat rounds, which may or may not result
    in a victor.
  • Chance of attacker promotion is half frequency: 2 battles
    required for same chance of promotion as 1 sea battle. 
  • Firepower is reduced to 1. Attack strength is increased +33%
    * Overall effect is -33% reduction in attack strength, less
      chance of promotion, less chance of fatality for either
      combatant, but generally in spite of this, more effective
      and tactically usable with more frequency in more
      contextual situations.
