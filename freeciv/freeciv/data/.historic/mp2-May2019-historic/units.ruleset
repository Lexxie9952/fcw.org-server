; Modifying this file:
; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes,
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.
;
; You should sort role units from worst to better, as often the best
; available role unit of a given sort will be picked by choosing
; the first available (not obsolete) such unit, or by picking the last
; such unit directly. When determining starting units, the first 
; unit with the relevant role that the player can build will be chosen.
; If no such unit can be found (eg Explorers that require Seafaring),
; then the first unit with this role will be chosen.
