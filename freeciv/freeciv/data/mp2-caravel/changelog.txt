Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
      Unneeded complexity should be reduced. Where needed for balance it is acceptable, but look for 
         other additions or modifications to ultimately reduce it.
      Simplicity is ideal exactly up to the point where it doesn't create imbalance, spam, or golden 
         path. Sometimes this can be obtained quite easily, other times it is difficult and first 
         solutions to solve balance issues might be more complex then later ways are found to reduce it.
   Balance, Playability, Realism, ideally all three, conflicts are resolved in that respective order.
   Several other Manifesto points:
      "Game of a lifetime", "Depth of strategy, diversity of strategy: i.e., reduce spamming contexts,
      reduce/eliminate Golden Path formulas."

   What motivates Ruleset additions
      Obviously a lot of new things appear, which seems to be throwing "the kitchen sink into the rules
      just for the fun of it." This is not what is happening. Everything is driven by #1 goal of balance,
      and additions happen when the easiest way to achieve that is to add something. Some new additions 
      rarely happen because of Playability and Realism, but most are because of Balance. We can't just 
      throw in "Saw Mill" because it seems "cool", as this may affect the balance of every other thing.
      Rather, when a balance issue is identified, sometimes the easiest way to solve it is through 
      creating a "holistic" counterbalance. If that counterbalance also supplies more playability, fun,
      and realism, THEN we add it.
   Issues 
      2x movement, side effect balancing.
      Non-infinite rails, side effect balancing.
      Rewonder 1.0, side effect balancing. Largest side effects:
         1. overpowering the rapture-based govs.
         2. "counts as a ... in every city" had rendered many improvements in the game useless, e.g. power plant, 
            hydro plant, nuclear plant, police station, cathedral, courthouse, etc. One by one, these are being
            morphed into more interesting layered effects instead of just "x in every city", which worked for
            Great Wonders fine, but created a kind of exponential imbalance where the more powerful you were,
            the more powerful you were (because the wonders represent cheaper and cheaper improvements), thus 
            resulting in a more exaggerated power imbalance between players.
   Almost all changes since MP2 started have been in response to these. Most smaller areas have already been 
      resolved or finalized (air unit balance and mechanics, unreachable exploits, infinite rails, etc.)
      
Focus goals for MP2-Caravel
1.  Increase splendor of the Bronze Age. Define your national race, characteristics, and unique path.
1a. Increase progress in the ruleset goal that the variety of wonders is such that there are too many to build: if you try, say hello
    to Horseys coming for you! Contunued enhancing of the "Too many wonders" characteristic continues to reduce the sameness or 
    similarity in national characteristics and same strategies, especially among the "Wonderboy" players. Each nation has to 
    carefully pick its diverse traits and advantages. Final result: more strategic breadth and variety, further progress toward 
    the goal of "game of a lifetime", continued elimination of "golden path" traits of the game.
2. Attempt the Final Re-balance of what 2x movement rates have done to foot units.
   Make Foot units a true tactical component again.
3. Re-balance of Govs toward the vibe and vision of what we know it should be like.
4. Enhance Trade routes and other mechanics to increase the Diplomatic / Economic bloc / Sovereign concerns of
   each individual nation:  Nerf mechanics forcing gang-alliance loyalties.

WONDERS:
========
1. Colossus: +1 trade on city center, -5 cost on most commerce units built in that city. 2 notch or ~22% increase to trade in its city. Bug-fix: Now must be built adjacent to Ocean.
2. Hanging Gardens now costs 210 and is obsolete by Steam Engine: 
   increase diversity of other early wonder strategies
   encourage Frigates before Ironclads
   more difficult for representative govs to rapture simultaneous to mid-game invasions
3. Magna Carta, new wonder, creates a new government Constitutional Monarchy which is half between Monarchy and Republic. 
   for the price of Oracle, Eiffel Tower, and Statue of Zeus, you basically get those same effects and a Republic-ish government: 
      1 extra content, 1 free unit upkeep, 1 more content about military than Republic, extra trade on land tiles, ability to rapture.
      One can also consider no lost turn of anarchy as a hidden discount in the 300 shield price. 
      What you don't get: 1 free trade on water (unless celebrating), lower chance of civil war, 80% max tax, the ability to choose
         those 300 shields went to some other more desired first investment than Oracle, Zeus, Eiffel Tower, as much trust from your
         peaceful neighbours. 
      What you get Republic that Republic doesn't, if it had spent 300 on Oracle, Eiffel Tower, and Zeus:  one free martial law,
      keep your capital production bonus, the ability to still make 1) Oracle, Eiffel Tower, and Zeus; 2) Your "free" Oracle and Zeus won't
      expire/become obsolete, less trust from your neighbours.
4. New Wonder Appian Way:  Foot units, Chariots and Wagons get move bonus from Appian Way. City with Appian gets discounts on Wagons. 
      increases revenue from trade routes approx. 10%, gives +1 trade to every road tile in its home city, 
      workers +1/3 move and build roads at double speed
5. Women's Suffrage small wonder combined with JSB small wonder made Democracy almost immune to the intended disadvantages it's supposed to have
      to counterbalance its superior economy. Women's Suffrage now counts as +1 happy in every city. This will keep a city content from one military
      but not necessarily help rapture it since rapture needs no unhappy; instead of formerly, 4 unhappy citizens about military all being forced
      content.  This makes slightly tunes Democracies to perform better at Peace and not as well for war. However, this also represents another slight
      nerf to democracy because once ONE player has it, it causes discontent in all representative governments which DON'T have it, thereby causing
      an obligatory 300 shield expense for democracies OR a nerf of +1 unhappy person in all democracies without it.
6. United Nations Wonder has new features which make it more globally interesting and strategic.
      1. When someone violates a treaty with another player, United Nations will give the whole world casus belli against that player. 
      2. Now that casus belli is tuned to work better, this opens up a lot more diplomatic intrigue and strategies from this wonder.
      3. Cost 500, was 600.
7. Statue of Zeus gains new ability, increases odds of veteran promotion by one third prior to discovery of Republic. 
8. Gibraltar Fortress was another "wonder in every city" that made the original improvement worthless, while itself adding no extra dynamic to the 
    game. It now becomes an extra commitment in cost to make existing coastal defenses stronger; also gives the one city it's built in a 3x defense
    against sea attacks, as an additional point of interest to balance out the new bombard abilities of battleships. Cost: 330 (was 350)
9. Hoover as small wonder made FOUR different improvements useless. This was an acceptable hack since Power Plants were one of the very 
    few areas that was imbalanced in original Civ2. Now, all 4 power plants are well-balanced, uniquely useful, and create different Economic
    paths and decisions regarding preferences over production/pollution/investment costs/tech priorities. Hoover is now a mega-production wonder
    in its individual city while giving small bonuses to all hydro plants in other cities. See also: Power Plants.
10. Fusion Reactor. The wonder model of "counts as x all cities" was moved from Hoover to The Fusion Reactor, which makes more sense. This model is 
    now frowned on for small wonders but, in this case it makes sense in the very end game when no one wants to be messing with power 
    plant upgrades in 75 cities. Not just for that reason: the major bonus of Fusion Power is selling off all the other power plants and going to 
    lower upkeep, lower pollution, and instantly having fusion power in all newly acquired cities. 
11. Pyramids gain from the server upgrade on EFT_GROWTH and confer 25% food to newly founded cities, now cost 200, and require Mathematics.
12. Wonder price adjustments 
    ** HG 210             
    ** A.Smith 320 - it's powerful!          
    ** Eiffel 125 - it was underpriced        
    ** Isaac 420 - slightly discourage everyone doing isaac
    ** Sun Tzu 310 - slightly discourage everyone having hardened units
13. The Sphinx, cost 70, tech req: none, reduces tile corruption (anarchy/despotism), halves city corruption, gives +1 luxury to city.
14. Marco Polo, as an embassy and outer relations/connections type of wonder, can't be lost in the conquest of a single city. 
    This is especially fair since: this is the only wonder in the game that is "required", one might say. This provides fairness to 
    all players who otherwise would prefer a "no wonder" strategy.
15. Roman Colosseum added. Entertainers give 3 lux instead of 2, now equal in net trade to scientists or taxmen. Each city with an 
   Amphitheater gains +1 happy and +1 luxury.
16. Chand Baori 
17. Medici Bank 
18. Roman Colosseum
19. Ziggurat.
20. Pax Dei, a diplomatic/political intrigue or trump card to capture middle ages dynamics. Works as a (very) short-term kind of united nations, 
   but can be used in devious ways as well.
CIVIL WONDERS are wonders that help define the charactertistics of your race, nation, and culture, and may alter its strategic
   path and possibilities. 
1. HG is now a Civil Wonder. 
2. Angkor Wat. +1 happy, all tiles in cities 3+ get celebration bonus when city is not celebrating, tile work on jungle/swamp 50% faster, 
               irrigation of lowlands faster, cost of Elephants -5 shields.
3. Mausoleum of Mausolos.
4. Code of Hammurabi, halves the gap between Despotism and Monarchy, and gives one content citizen. CIVIL WONDER.

BUILDINGS:
==========
1. Barracks requirement is Warrior Code. Besides making sense and rewarding early discovery of that tech as a diverse strategy to pursue, it 
   balances out the longturn's format of giving starting gold and extra disbandable units.
 a. Barracks II 35, Barracks III 40.
2. Coinage yields 3 gold per 2 shields, (i.e., 1.5 gold per shield), so it no longer a "useless" feature taking up game space.
 a. Marketplace, Bank, and Stock Exchange each add 0.25 to the conversion rate (1.75,2.00,2.25, respectively).
      1. requires all earlier buildings present, 2. not Communist gov, 3. the final bonus for Stock Exchange also requires The Corporation
3. Police Station prevents investigate city for all govs except Democracy.
 a. Since Foreign Nationals are categorised as "discontent about military", Police Station now works on those for all governments (was Repub/Demo only)
4. Courthouse prevents Diplomats (not Spies) from doing hostile Embassy without first cease-fire or peace.
5. City Walls were sometimes too cheap, sometimes too expensive, sometimes too OP, etc., this was very similar to the issue with Fortresses 
   that was fixed earlier with the Fort/Fortress distinction. The new City Walls solution breaks into two types somewhat modeled on the 
   Fort / Fortress solution now. 
   City Fortifications are available with Masonry and provide 1.75x; 
   City Walls come with Construction and remain 3x. (Same for Great Wall wonder.)
   Just as with Fort/Fortress, City Fortifications are cheaper/easier to build but not as strong. Also same is that they don't 
   stack. And also same is Masonry for first, Construction for second. 
   City Walls which cost 80 in Civ2, cost 65 now in early game, and 75 after discovery of Steel.
   Fortifications for cities that get Walls later are not lost investment. Selling Fortifications in a city with City Walls will recoup
   the full gold price of the Fortifications. Be sure to have the City Walls made first. 
   If City Walls are sabotaged, you can keep the Fortifications for a weaker backup.
   With some kinds of terrain, Fortifications modify, integrate, and are built into the terrain itself: Swamp, Forest, Jungle.
   This raises the terrain defense bonus of Swamp, Forest, and Jungle to 1.5x, 1.5x, and 1.67x respectively (+17%) 
6. SAM Battery cost 80 (was 70) [100 in Civ2]
7. Coastal Defense cost 65, upkeep 2. (Civ2: 80, 1). Micro-balances economic inflation effects and complaints C.D. is too cheap/strong/easy/common 
     for preventing naval attacks. See also: Gibraltar Fortress.
8. Power Plants refactoring. Formerly, each plant had identical characteristics in upkeep and output, with the only difference being that
     you paid WAY more than it's worth to get less pollution. Now, each Power Plant has a different profile for output, pollution, upgrade
     incentives, and so on. They fit together well in a meta-system, not just with themselves, but with other improvements. 
  a. Solar Plant and the new Wind Plant are no longer (only one type can co-exist in the same city.)

GOVERNMENT RE-BALANCE:
* ALL NON-REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENTS:
1. Courthouse gives +1 content to all govs, not just Democracy 
2. Statue of Zeus makes 1 citizen content about military for govs who need that, and if not, simply 1 citizen content.
* DESPOTISM
   Gains new "Gulag" ability: can starve cities without disorder if 2 martial law units are there.
* MONARCHY:
   gets the option to build Magna Carta to become a half/hybrid between monarchy and republic characteristics, which opens 
   up intriguing different strategies or counter-strategies to others. Magna Carta activates the new gov 
* CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY
* FUNDAMENTALISM:
0. Renamed to Theocracy and re-balanced to be more competitive.
1. Theocratic govs are harder to bribe, cost is 2x.
2. Pilgrams have no pop_cost! Now, it's like buying rapture for 10 shields. Pilgrims use ONE city-build-slot instead of all.
3. Government now gets the "generate partisans" effect.
4. Fanatics renamed to Zealots, otherwise same unit, except:
   a. They can skirmish assault cities which have foreign populations (e.g., your recently conquered city)
   b. Available with Conscription, not Fundamentalism which is no longer a tech.
5. -50% bulbs in exchange for free upkeep on temples/make_content buildings, was a harsh penalty. Changed to:  
   a. Bonus/penalty is symmetric now: -20% for sci, +20% for gold.
6. New unit Falconeer represents the Janissaries and Hand cannoneers employed by mediaevel theocratic orders.  
* COMMUNISM:
1. Proletarians have 1 pop_cost but add 2 pop. Same +1 net pop as Pilgrims, but can better use granary dynamics and magnify state populace control of "boom-town" growth. One city build slot used, not all.
2. Communists: 10 shield discount on Armor I.
3. Gains new "Gulag" ability: can starve cities without disorder if martial_law count is 3 or more. (each unit counts for 2, each police station for 2.)
* DEMOCRACY:
1. Democracy has base corruption level of 8%, (half of Republic/Monarchy)
2. Democracy: corruption increases by 0.4% per tile from capital (1/5 that of most other govs (=2%))
3. Democracies can now be BRIBED, but cost is 3x. 
4. Democacies can now be INCITED TO REVOLT, but cost is 3x.
5. Democracy can't rapture with 10% or more foreign citizens.
6. Also see, Hanging Gardens, Police Station, Women's Suffrage.
* NATIONALISM
1. New government, see manual for details. An modern authoritarian warlike government that, on a one-for-one per capita population comparison, is quite economically
   capable of competing with democracies.
* FOREIGN NATIONALS:
1. 40% are unhappy, increase from 34%.
2. Fixed, was sometimes rounding up too high, the number of your own nationals in a newly conquered city.

UNITS/COMBAT/MECHANICS:
* FOOT UNITS
1. "Hand-me-down upgrade bonus":
   Early foot convert to Musketeers for free in domestic cities upon discovering Conscription.
   Musketeers "        " Riflemen    "    "   "    "        "     "      "       Labor Union.
2. Pre-feudal foot units (Warrior, Archer, Phalanx, Legion) cost 20% less.
3. Feudal foot units (Pikemen) cost 10% less.
4. Marines can now: build Fort/Airbase, but not Airbase in a Fort.
      Gain +2 move frags per vet level
      V2+ can do ranged Bazooka Attack for 3 rounds on up to 2 targets.
      Note this does not represent superior range of Marines to other units/weaponry, but rather
         special commando training for fast initiative surprise degradation tactics, concealment advantage, etc.
      Marines cost 55 (was 60).
5. Paratroopers A7 D5. Cost 55 (was 60)
6. Partisans cost 45 (was 50).
7. Shift from shield to gold upkeep for Infantry changed from Labor Union to Banking. Allows realistic foot soldier compositions to affect more of the game.
* SPECIAL UNIT ABILITIES - This is a new MP2 design goal to increase tactical depth, unit diversity, playstyle variety, realism accuracy, and even further reduce "golden pathing" of military strategies.
1. SPECIAL UNIT ATTACKS. Tactical depth blossoms: Now possible are: Hit-and-run tactics; multiple ranged attacks per turn; engagements with less than all units on the tile.
      Phalanx, Rumble Attack: 3 combat rounds, stays fortified, can hit 1 unit, can kill no units, uses 5/9 moves, requires 1 move left, requires fortified or not moved prior.
      Legion, Pilum Assault: 1 combat round, 2x attack, can hit 2 units, can kill 2 units, uses 1 move.
      Archers, Volley attack: 2 combat rounds (was 1), stays fortified, can hit up to 7 units (was unlimited), can kill no units, uses 1 5/9 moves (was turn loss), can attack water.
      Fanatics, Skirmish assault: 3 combat rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill no units, uses 1 5/9 moves. Now, can also assault conquered foreign-occupied cities.
      Marines, Bazooka attack: 3 combat rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill 1 unit, uses 1 5/9 moves, can hit oceanic (but not while transported)
      Battleship, Bombard attack: 3 combat rounds, 4 units, can kill 1, uses 5 moves.
      Catapult, Cannon, Artillery, Howitzer can defend against bombard/ranged/special unit attacks at 4,5,6,7 combat rounds, respectively.
2. iPILLAGE. Instant Pillage is tactically significant. Formerly, roads under rails couldn't be pillaged in one turn. Scorched Earth and Blitz tactics barely existed in the game.
      NOTE: iPillage Odds increase +5% per vet level.
      Dive Bomber - 50% odds, 1 selectable target, 7 move cost. 
      Ground Strike Fighter - 75% odds, 1 selectable target, 3 moves cost.
      Armor I/II - 75% odds, 1 selectable target, 2 move cost.
      Strategic Bomber - 60% odds, 1 random target, 3 move cost.
      Jet Bomber - 75% odds, 2 random targets, 3 move cost.
3. SPECIAL STANDARD ATTACKS
      Phalanx and Marines can stay fortified during attack.
* PRICE CHANGES
    Pre-feudal units -20% foot, -10% mounted. Catapult 34.
    Feudal:          -10% foot, -5% mounted.  Armor II: 85 (was 80)
* UNITS:
1. Siege Ram: Must use roads. SPECIAL UNIT ATTACKS:
    Attack City Walls. 50% chance to destroy city walls (requires 1 full move point), odds halved against capitals.
    Ram Fortress:      attack on fortified walls is emulated by up to 4hp damage on each occupant, emulating a 0 to 80% reduction of Fortress defense bonus; which may be partly/fully repaired/recovered each successive turn.
    Two Rams will likely render Fortress defense into liability. Troops who remain in a Fortress facing two Siege Rams will be damaged and demoralized from breaches
    and crushing stone debris. But, proactive defenders can pillage the Fortress and use its stone to improvise fortified structures (a Fort, which is left after a Fortress is pillaged) 
    That is, render the tile into an unrammable Fort which still gets a 1.33x bonus protection from stack kill.
    The net effect of this realistically emulates that Fortresses are dominant military presences until attackers take the time and wherewithal to get around 
    to protracted siege, whereafter they are still defendable but at a lesser bonus.
2. Satellite: invisible, can investigate all cities (even with Police Station), has superior vision and movement. Requires Apollo Program.
3. Zeppelin:  upgrades balloon, greater vision/movement/fuel, some limited attack capabilities, can do limited bombing.
4. Helicopter fixed, correctly susceptible to SAM Battery not City Walls (fixes a nerf of 3x for a land unit not from original game)
   this fix was retroactive to AG and Brava also, as it was a really bad treason against the branch's DNA.
5. Battleship gets ranged attack: 3 rounds, can hit up to 4 units, can kill up to 1 unit, uses 5 moves.
6. Truck replaces Freight. Changes: Road only, moves: 6, can carry 3 land units. load/unload rules same as Train.
7. Discovery of Recycling reduces unit upgrades 20%, stacks with other discounts.
8. A server flaw sometimes
   a. allowed military units to clean fallout and pollution. This fix affects ALL rulesets.
   b. For non-military units, only spies and worker types can pillage now. Excluded are: Caravans, Explorers, Diplomats, Pilgrims, Tribesmen, Trucks, Freight.
9. Base Stack Escape odds are 60%, not 50%. 50% is too coin-flip on live or die for anyone to really use or count on this bonus.
      Higher, however, can give too much power to stacks. 
9a. Destroyer types are fast and have 67% stack escape odds. Submarines are submerged and have 75% stack escape odds.
10. Fighter is D3.5, Escort Fighter is A3.5.

BALLISTIC sub-class 
1. Catapults and their upgrade line (Cannon, Artillery, Howitzer) are now the Ballstic sub-class of the Land unit class. This line of units gets an increasing +25% upgrade over 
   the obsolete unit, in how much of the Fortification/City Wall bonus it reduces. Catapult takes -25% from Fortifications and Wall bonuses. This represents their 
   special unit ability, makes them all a more logical family progression (instead of all -0% then Howitzer is suddenly -100% bonus). It also helps these
   slow units fit much better into their historic realistic tactical uses, inside the game.
2. Catapult > Cannon > Artillery > Howitzer is now an evolutionary sub-class of land units for Ballistic/Siege/City Busting as their 
   special unit ability or distinction. Each one gets a special bonus against City Defense improvements that progressively grows until
   arriving at Howitzer. This does a lot for game balance and logic.
2. Ballistic sub-class special unit ability is that it can retaliate against ranged special unit attacks from other unit types. They may be 
   weak defenders up close, but be careful shooting arrows or bazookas at them from far away, or you might regret it.

SPIES/DIPLOMATS:
1. Diplomatic units now defend a unit on a tile from hostile diplomatic acts (bribe/sabotage), the same as they defend a city from hostile diplomat attacks.
   a. In the case where bribe/sabotage isn't possible (i.e., other non-diplomat units > 1), no defense is necessary since it's "No action possible."
   b. Where it is only the case of 1 diplomat vs. 1 enemy diplomat, they enter into diplomatic combat, the same as in a city.
   c. Spies promotion odds increased to compensate for the weaker strength of their veterancy levels, to make it track more similar 
      to other units for number of successful surviving actions.
   d. Spies can investigate city from a transport, but not other actions.
   e. Diplomats can investigate city without being spent.
2. Investigate City is now no longer hard-coded in server to 100% success. What this means for MP2:
   80% chance to COVERTLY SLIP past enemy diplomats/spies WITHOUT diplomatic combat. (100% if unprotected)
   If slipped past OR defeated enemy diplomats in combat, 85% chance to succeed at investigating city.
   FINAL ODDS: 
      85% chance to investigate unprotected city
      ~75% chance to succeed vs. protected city (varies slightly up or down with the vet levels of the spy units in combat.)
      causes casus belli on failure!
3. Conquered cities with Foreigners have a +10% chance of success in sabotage actions.
4. Cities with 50% or more foreign citizens are considered occupied warzones, rather than cozy places where spies can 
      steal weapons techs from scientists at the university. No tech theft from a city that is half or more foreign.
      This fixes some ridiculous cases where u couldn't conquer a city because ur afraid to give Mass Production to your enemy,
      even though u could try as hard as hell to make sure no soldiers are carrying out tech briefcases on how to do Mass Prod.

OTHER:
1.Casus Belli Expansions:
   a. In a foreign territory casus belli is given by:  Transforming Terrain, Building Base, or making road-types (road,rail,quay,canal,etc.)
   b. Bribe enemy unit.
   c. Found City on foreign territory (i.e., in a Fort.)
   d. Capture Units (fixed an unknown server bug that allows this to work now.)
   e. Investigate City if discovered when dong it.
   f. Moving military units inside foreign territory with whom you have Cease-fire, Peace, Armistice:
      NOTE, if you accept cease-fire while inside someone's territory, moving the units will give casus belli. Be out first.
   g. Formerly, casus belli lasted 2 turns: the turn of the incident and one after. mp2c now uses the new server setting 
      casusbelliturns and defaults to 12.
2. Improved tuning of terrain dispersion; less domination in some areas by a single terrain type.
3. Balance Alignment of Resource Distribution (BARD. 1. On the first TC, BARD allocates a SMALL amount of:
   Berries, Spice, Peat, Oasis, Rubber, Gems, Elk, Furs, Ivory, and Iron, in order to enhance statistical
   balance in each climactic region. Typically this is less than a 4% chance per tile, with exact value tuned to regional
   geographic balance. (Swamp and Arctic get somewhat more.) 2. BARD overcomes the map generator's forced 35%
   chance a tile gets a resource, regardless of terrain, resource type, or scarcity of nearby resources on other tiles.
   3. BARD discourages settling on the first turn, giving one turn of "oxygen" for all players to look around before settling
   their cities. This was preferred to proposals to disallow settling on first turn, or to exaggerate inconsistent special
   exception bonuses for starting moves, exceptions to terrain movement penalties for x turns, etc., etc.
3a. Furs can now exist on Arctic terrain. This provides more balance to the worst terrain type in the game.
4. "Blood for Oil":  After Refining, Oil Wells built on Oil get +1 shield after other bonuses. 
     (Previously, it was arguably better to irrigate rather than mine.) Oil tiles with more value are now more worth fighting for.
5. Monotheism 384 (was 415), Theology 600 (was 725), Theocracy 725
6. Added Castle. Built on top of Fortress. a. Units inside can't be seen. b. Moat prevents Siege Rams. c. Claims more surrounding tiles. d. Sees farther.
 e. No extra defense bonus.
   reqs: Construction, Feudalism. Obsolete by: Gunpowder.
7. Added Bunker. Built on top of Fortress. a. Units inside can't be seen. b. Prevents Air and Missile attacks. 
   c. Prevents tile pillage (so Jet Bomber etc. can't remove it) d. Claims less surrounding tiles, doesn't see as far, no extra defense bonus.
   reqs: steel
8. Trade re-balance. You've only got one trade route per city so we're going to make it mean something. Trade and Project Honeycomb are now
   ready to come into the game with some real meaning!
   Traderoutes add a hard +1 trade to the city centre.
   One-time gold bonus for establishing a trade route is now the standard freeciv bonus. It's a lot more, but it's only once per city. 
   4x one-time gold bonus for establishing trade routes between capitals, if it's before Banking is discovered.
   Base route revenues is now 50% higher than standard. With only one route instead of 4, this means you're still getting 
      only 37.5% from trade routes as the former (OP) trade dynamics. But 37.% of OP is something substantial.
      Marco Polo continues to take care of the other 3 routes you would have had under standard rules, keeping the game simpler.
      For all these bonuses is a price to pay. Minimum distance for trade routes is now 20 tiles... reaching out farther is a small balance
         to pay for your higher bonus. Encourages more world-interconnectivity and intrigue, and even banditry and piracy.

Commerce units simplified. All commerce can build wonders and do trade routes at all times under all conditions.
   Trade tech isn't needed for Trade routes. Trade tech simply increases Trade revenue higher rates.
Ships cost 2x to bribe -- injured ships far from home had too low bribe costs for what you're getting, additionally, input showed a
   split on whether ships should even be bribable at all.
Damaged Submarine min_speed=4 (was 3); makes hit-and-run and escape somewhat more viable.
Nuclear winter was patches of random arctic everywhere, now it a temperature downgrade of each affected tile to one level colder.
Starting Caravans have all restrictions and complications removed. Can Help Wonder or Establish Trade Route (remember to set Home City first!)
Camels move faster than people, Caravans get 2 7/9 moves. They can also carry 2 Goods units. 
Capturable commerce units can't become uncapturable just by carrying Goods or being on same tile with other capturable commerce units.
   This prevents mere cargo from making commerce units immune to capture.  Cargo becomes lost in a capture event: e.g., Caravan carrying
   goods gets captured. Goods are lost, Caravan transfers ownership.
Tribesmen become primitive generalists who can do a mediocre job at many things, rather than specialized to one thing like other units.
   This makes them perfect start units for a primitive tribe to slowly get itself going: 
      They can work tiles like Workers, but only contribute a half-worker turn instead of a full worker-turn.
      They can now fight (A1D1 HP6), but at 60% the strength of a warrior, are not so amazing.
      Semi-military, semi-civilian:
         They cannot capture, expel, or conquer cities.
         Like before, they are capturable and expellable.
Workers now have 6hp, so they are not equal to a Warrior in combat, yet still can feel safer running for the hills or other defense terrain.
Because Workers and Tribesmen are 6hp, the Warrior now becomes somewhat more meaningful as having primitive military ability.
Coastal Defense is visible without middle-clicking for city info: it puts 4 cannon towers in the corners, and cannon placements along the walls.
Masonry is not needed for Palace (simplification)
Tribesmen, Diplomats, and Explorers can investigate cities without being spent. Let the games of ancient espionage and paranoia begin !
Train goes from 1 gold upkeep to 0. Cost was too high for achieving parity for foot unit mobility on rails.
Worker turns to irrigate swamp or plant forest go from 8 to 6½. In almost all cases, that means 7.
CANALS
   Formerly:
      Coastal Canals could be made Adjacent to Ocean. 
      Inland Canals could be made Adjacent to River.
      results: canal length artificially limited, some glitch cases where diagonal canal doesn't really connect to Ocean.
   Now:
      Coastal Canals can be made CAdjacent to Ocean.
      Inland Canals can be made CAdjacent to River OR Coastal Canal.
      results: max canal length across an isthmus goes from 2 to 3, and all canals properly and visibly exit into Oceans.
      thanks to @Dino for figuring out some logic to do these things.
MINOR 
------------------------
Conscription bonus simplified - applies to infantry only.
Galleon, like Caravel,Galley,etc., can enter Peace Waters but may not attack unless war declared: this ensures a naval vessel
   always exists which can bring commerce units to coastal cities; and realistically reflects the historic use of real Galleons.
Spy Plane correctly made to be unreachable to propeller-based aircraft.
Can't make road-types while transported in foreign lands (road/quay/rail/maglev/canal)
   move to mp2-brava
+1/9 move bonus for v4+ aircraft was changed to +1, as it too frequently led to death of precious v4 units from tired attack on last move.
   move to MP2-brava
Ram Ship can see 1 tile around it and travel on rivers - prevents unintended attacks when travelling diagonally.
   move to MP2-brava (except not the travel on river part)
Fallout disappear chance changed from 20% to 15%
Small clarification: to use a train requires < 3 moves, not <= 2 moves. (Doesn't change who can use it, just clarifies rare cases.)
Canals can serve as an irrigation source.
Magnetism tech costs 875, was 950. Halves the extra cost over Gunpowder. Further encourages Frigates before Ironclads.
Environmentalism "hack" to reduce production pollution by 50% was removed. It was a hacked misfit for flaws in other pollution reduction.
   Now that other solutions exist for that, this advance reduces pollution from population by 50% instead.
   Regarding production pollution, please see notes on how Power Plants, Recycling Center, Solar Plant, Wind Plant, and Fusion Reactor, layer together.

SERVER UPGRADES:
1. Special Unit Actions / Attacks:
   a. can optionally specify a move cost up to 7 moves points.
   b. can optionally specify a limit to number of units on tile which can be hit
   c. can optionally specify a maximum number of units who can be potentially killed
   d. can optionally specify a unit stays fortified when doing the action.
2. Population units can specify pop-cost and add-pop differently. 
3. Non-diplomatic units can be made to enter "direct combat with buildings": e.g., Siege Ram vs. City Walls. 
5. Bulb cost displays now reflect non-default sciencebox settings 
6. Fixed design flaw in server that made pop-cost units take up all a city's build slots.  
7. Made units-display in lower-right update correctly more often (not showing dead/spent/disbanded units.) Please report any exceptional cases.
8. Fixed possibilities for some rare backdoors.
9. DIPLOMATIC ACTION REPORTING TRANSPARENCY: all diplomatic actions show the odds and results for all stages to both contestants.
10. Unit vision range now reported in raw tile units rather than square of radius.
11. Fortresses and Naval Bases show a flag of who owns them to prevent confusion, fixed first version incorrectly showed a buoy.
12. Fixed variety of small quirks/inconsistencies in loading/unloading of transports.
13. Added ability for rulesets to include the "Sea Bridge" improvement over water. Must be CAdjacent on lake or ocean (not deep ocean)
16. Hovering over a Special Unit Attack button in the Attack pop-up window, now gives info-text for all its special traits and requirements (from mp2-c onward)
17. Fixed rounding errors in displayed upgrade costs on client side.
18. Fixed upstream server bug that didn't allow capture units to trigger casus belli.
19. Added ability for effects to be triggered by unit activity states (instead of only completed actions.)
20. There was a hidden flaw in 3.0 server, any unit who can do ANYTHING to a tile gets magic bonus to also clean pollution and fallout. 
      This was affecting foot soldiers (who can make hideouts) so we went with the flow. But now this flaw is fixed, and we're back to the
      classical orthodoxy:  only non-military tile workers can clean fallout and pollution (worker, engineer, settler, proletarian)
21. A bug in main freeciv server caused climate change to lag, often not completing for several minutes, with a high probability of crashing.  This exists in all
    versions of freeciv but FCW had to hard-code global warming out because the problem was exponentially worse on larger maps.
    This now has following fixes and upgrades:
    1. New settings for STRENGTH of nuclear winter and global warming exist (how much of earth is affected if triggered.)
    2. New percent setting allows adjusting the threshold that triggers climate events, and the tolerance/absorption of the earth to diminish 
       the accumulation of impact over time.
    3. TC Climate Change processing takes onyl seconds instead of several minutes.
    4. It doesn't crash.
    5. Note: the defaults for these settings were always ON in all games, they were just not triggered because a patch prevented their 
       execution to prevent crashing. So, be careful of global warming.
    6. New feature: IPCC report gives transparency on risk of climate change if the risk starts to escalate.  
    7. Climate Report is now in Gov tab.
22. Landmass can be set from 10 to 99 (was 15 to 85)
UI / Ease of use / Macro-management mechanics.
23. Mass select Airlift: you can select multiple units and give them simultaneous airlift command, which will execute in sequential order if each is legal.
    This upgrades one-at-a-time airlifting.
24 Intelligent Load/Unload/Activate Cargo are now upgraded to work holistically with each other.
   UNLOAD TRANSPORT 'T':
    a. 'T' tells a selected Transport(s) to unload their specific cargo.
    b. 'T' tells selected Cargo to unload from their Transports. 
   LOAD 'L': 
    a. 'L' Load selected units on Transport(s).
    b. 'L' Load ONE selected Transport with all units on the tile which it can legally take as cargo. ("Cargo Scoop")
    c. 'L' Transfer selected Cargo units to other Transports IFF such action would be legal if the cargo can legally unload then reload. 
    d. 'L' command given at Sea, to tell selected Cargo to move to a new Transport, is legal if current Transport has moved no more than 4
        moves and has at least 3 moves left.
    
    has used half or more of its 
           moves AND has more than 3 moves left. This may seem complex but it is a "Sweet spot" compromise to allow legitimate "Transport transfer"
           while hindering the "Transport shuffle" exploit.
   SELECT CARGO on TRANSPORT 'U':
    a. 'U' command will only select Cargo units on the SELECTED Transport(s).
    b. If no Transport is selected, 'U' commamnd does its old behaviour to select ALL cargo units on the tile.
   What no longer happens:
   1. 'T' will never do as previously, it unloaded ALL cargo on same tile, making multiple load/unload operations tedious.
   2. 'U' command will never select all cargo on same tile, only on selected Transports.
   3. 'L' command won't disallow swapping Cargo between Transports in cities because you didn't take the extra step of unloading first.
   4. 'L' command doesn't force you to click-select every unit you want to load. Now you can select the Transport who scoops up all legal units instead.
24a. Can "Transport swap" Land-type cargo units in
   1) where it's legal to unload anyway, to save an extra step (cities, naval bases, quays)
   2) in sea units who have enough moves (see 24.'L.d.)
25. iPillage - this uses the server's new surgical strike pillage feature, where tiles can be destroyed in real-time on par with everything else
    (buildingis, units, etc.)  iPillage brings Scorched Earth and Blitzkrieg into the game; gives Air Strikes more of a real purpose, increases 
    the tactical importance of Vigil, as well as the placement of Forts, more Foot soldiers, and AAA, to protect regional infrastructure. 
    Features can be set for each unit:
      success odds, move cost, pin-point single target, or multiple random targets in one strike.
      note: the documented iPillage odds go up +5% for each veteran level.
26. Added "gold per shield" info to the City screen (custom user column) and on pop-up window to buy item.
27. Added option to enter Full Screen (full immersion) like every non-browser game, when the game launches. ESC is now dedicated to exiting 
    Full Immersion (ALT-S or Options>>Full Screen) to re-enter. You are no longer required to hit ESC to exit tabs and pop-up windows, and lose 
    full screen display. Instead, the command to exit any tab or pop-up window is "W" for (W)ithdraw (W)indow. This now allows the game to default 
    into an orthodox full screen experience like Freeciv Native Client and EVERY OTHER GAME, instead of being a "second class browser game."
   Recommended: become familiar with your OS's hotkeys, which better enable you to navigate while having a fullscreen process:
28. Fortify given to non-fortifiable units will sentry them instead, and if they can't sentry, they will be given "No Orders" (J) and stay put.
    This turns the F key into the magic spam key for making unit(s) stay put and select their best option on the tile. It allows giving F
    to a large stack and every unit who can fortify will, while sentrying the rest, so you can move on, and maybe spam F again, rapidly.
    Reason: quicker/easier micro-management during late game.
28a. Sentry given to non-sentryable units will NO-ORDERS them instead.
29. Triremes on sentry on all legal refueling spots (formerly could not sentry on coastline.)
30. Size 1 cities aren't impervious to infinite nukes while every other city is cut in half each time. Now s1 cities die if nuked.
31. Investigate City now has:
     1. "diplchance" odds (80%) of avoiding diplomatic battle even if enemy spy is present (was 100%) - "Covert Slip Attempt"
     2. Then [possibly] diplomatic battle,
     3. Then "diplchance"+(ruleset odds) chance to succeed. MP2 gives a +5% over base diplchance of 80, or 85% chance to succeed at this phase.
What this means for MP2 rules: 
   80% chance to slip past enemy diplomats/spies without diplomatic combat. (100% if unprotected)
   If slipped past OR defeated enemy diplomats in combat, 85% chance to succeed at investigating city.
   Thus, 85% chance to investigate unprotected city, and about 75% chance to succeed vs. protected city (plus or minus with vet levels of spies.)
32. Spies could only sabotage city production at random but not targeted. This was fixed: targeted sabotage now lists "Production" as one of the 
   choices along with the improvements.
33. Info-codes. Special info symbols mark the messages you get in the chat window, to make it easier/faster to scan and read important events,
    or to scroll back to find again.
34. 3 NEW DEMOGRAPHICS statistics: Units Built, Units Killed, Units Lost. We can also select which rows in demographics report to show, and also 
    which of 3 columns to turn on (your quantitative score, your rank, who is #1 and their quantitative score [if you have embassy])
35. Discovery of new government gives instant click-link icon to change government, in the chat window.
36. Recycling Unit is smarter to differentiate single or plural simultaneous; and differentiate a disbanding from a recycling into production. Also new 
   Orders button for Recycle/Disband has same intelligence to it.
37 CTRL-click: clicks a tile as if a city is not there: good for selecting units without extra UI fussing (going inside a city to pick the unit etc.)
38. Special retaliation ability: units defending from ranged attacks now have the potential to retaliate if they also can range attack...
    "ranged defense".  This opens up new tactics currently given only to units that benefit from big balance improvement from it 
    (Archer, Battleship, Helicopter.) Note that ranged defense requires there to be move points left.
        one Bship bombards 2, now they have 37 hp and 1 Bship beats both. This prevents such possibilities and indeed, 
        the 2 battleships properly retaliate leaving the single Bship in worse, not better condition. This dynamic is
        carefully used to allow deeper level of tactics for some units and to slightly buff units whose special
        role abilities were represented weaker than the realistic and tactical use they should have.
39. fixed rounding errors in calculation of move points on damaged units.
40. adding a pop unit to a city arranges tiles by its CMA (server default or governor) instead of making entertainer.
40a. fixed small bug where ranged attacks did not reduce movement points of damaged units.
41. TC reports on UWT activity delays now only report activities that finish this turn; Not anymore, e.g., transform or mine that finishes on a future turn.
42. possibly fixed spurious message re:UWT
43. Note, unit emoji are not for gimmick fun, but:
      a) help you scan a long list of info to parse it or find the right info, 
      b) the ACTOR unit has the emoji before the name, the TARGET unit has the emoji after the name (after getting the habit, this helps a lot with #1)
44. Middle-click in tech screen for setting future goal, doesn't slip into scroll-pane mode.  Alt-right click now works as middle click in tech screen
45. defending units lost in cities, now inform the player what city they were in when they were lost, so they can know better where the attack was 
      without having to click the text link.
47. chatbox scrolling to end of page after getting a message, was sometimes slow and lazy, just like that person that does most of the job but 
   quits before it's done. now after a certain time of getting a new message and scrolling it, it is force snapped to the bottom.
48. every event in chat that took place somewhere on the map, is a link to center the map there, AND will select the unit there if there is one, 
      OR else make a signal marker to identify the exact tile.
49. Poisoning a size 1 city eliminates it. (all rulesets)
50. Kill-stack events sometimes left you ignorant, seeing "Killed the Riflemen and 5 other units!".  Now, up to 6 other unit kills are reported in a kill-stack,
   individually, before it will start to just say (and x other units!)
51. CITY GOVERNOR, with advanced features not found in native client or upstream server.
52. fixed, sound effect for sold building only happens when server confirms it's really a legal sale.
53. server has new effect rulesets can use, for increasing/decreasing the work rate of units.
54. units fortifying inside a hideout now have aqua fortifying icon to show they're in a hideout, similar to sentry and (already) fortified.
55. new server settings hangry and fulldisorder. 
      hangry - fixes a logic flaw in TC processing, where people were happier starving with lux, than being fed to avoid starvation and death.
      fulldisorder - closes a couple exploits/loopholes where heavy micromanagement of disorder gains a competitive edge.
                     disorder is very simple now: all production and purchasing power for 1 turn is stopped if disorder is not prevented before TC;
                     like celebration, when disorder status occurs, the effects of it are felt on the turn when it's reached (i.e., the TC after it happens) 
                     2. conquered cities count as a kind of disorder as far as being able to produce anything after conquest, and/or also toward 
                        the rule of 2 turns of disorder causing anarchy to democracy.
56. fixed a bug that was not giving score for small wonders
57. full 2-way casus belli status displayed in nations tab.
58. Diplomacy Pacts Upgrades:
    a. You may forget or excuse a casus belli, possibly from some verbal agreement over an action or maneuver which generates a casus belli,
       simply by doing another Cease-Fire, or Peace. This clears the casus belli or "forgives past casus belli".
    b. When a Cease-Fire has 3 or less turns left, you may create a new one, instead of being forced to wait for it to expire into war.
    c. Doing a Cease-Fire or Peace agreement when you already have one but there is casus belli, will not reset the length of the agreement, 
       but only pardon the casus belli.
    d. Doing a Cease-Fire or after casus belli is reset, sets a new one with a new length of time, as set by GM in game.server.ceasefirelength.  
    e. (b,c,d) give players the ability to choose separate combinations of excusing casus belli and re-affirming 
       cease-fire for a new time period.
    f. De-jankification of all kinds of rare edge cases is tedious to explain but there are 2 charts for full disclosure at
         diplhand.c line 545 and line 603. In general it's made to be softer more fluid and do what's logical in edge cases, rather than fall
         and get stuck in one of the "stupid logic holes of freeciv diplomacy".
   Short answer: if you ask for the same type of pact as you had before, it will excuse casus belli if you have it, otherwise, if the pact 
      expires very soon, it assumes you want to offer to renew it before expiration.
59. Server settings armisticelength and ceasefirelength are now under the control of the GM.
60. Two-way state of casus belli is shown in nations list in nations tab now. Mouse hover shows turns left.
61. chat marks speaker with their flag. sent messages are right aligned, allied chat and global chat are center, incoming are left aligned. 
62. added game.server.casusbelli turns for better control over casus belli. Formerly it was 2 turns (turn of incident and one after.)
   Now it is configurable by GM, and multiple violations/aggrievances can push it beyond the default time length (12 for mp2c, 2 for all others.)
63. New Prefs option: Focus Lock, keeps the current selected unit centered on map (ALT-SHIFT-F). It's more of a preference on a PC, but might 
    make a big improvement for mobile. On mobile it defaults to on.
64. Prefs options for "Show pollution on map" and "Movement Point Display" can now be permanently set instead of temporarily.
65. There was no way for EFT_GROWTH_FOOD to be applied at city founding and this is now fixed. Rulesets wanting old behaviour of no extra food 
      in this situation, need to put a MinSize, "1", City condition into them.
66. Stack Escape changed to be unit is of equal or greater moves than attacker. (was greater)
67. New server effect "Stack_Escape_Pct" allows regulating odds of stack escape in certain situations, instead of hard-coded universal 50%, always.
68. New server feature to allow negative upkeep buildings. Allows improvements which gather infrastructural support to other buildings, 
   e.g., wind mills, khan's tribute collection office, etc.
69. Improvement super panel in city list now filters out obsolete buildings and buildings who tech req is 2 or more tiers away. This makes the 
    list much more compact and easy to use.
70. minor_nukes and major_nukes are not shown in tech tree unless the server setting allows them for that game. if you see it, you can build it!
