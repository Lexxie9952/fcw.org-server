legend=_("Gatherers, hunters and fishermen, the Ohlone lived in\
 over 40 bands stretching from the San Francisco Bay south to the\
 Salinas Valley. They spoke eight distinct yet related languages\
 and though they shared many cultural traits common to other Native\
 Californian peoples, the Ohlone were also diverse in some finer\
 aspects of culture. Their way of life changed dramatically when the\
 Spanish arrived in 1769 and disease and the injustices of Mission\
 life came to replace their earlier lives. Though the last fluent speaker\
 of an Ohlone language died in 1939, the Ohlone are today federally\
 recognized as 7 tribes.")
