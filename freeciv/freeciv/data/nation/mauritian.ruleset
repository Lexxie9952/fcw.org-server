legend=_("Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean. It was first settled\
 by the Dutch, who named it after Maurice of Nassau. The island is famous\
 for being the habitat of the dodo, which was was brought to extinction\
 within a century after its discovery. The Dutch abandoned the island in\
 1710 and Mauritius was subsequently settled by the French. During the\
 Napoleonic Wars the island was captured by the British. The island\
 became independent in 1968. Nowadays, Mauritius is one of the most\
 developed countries of Africa. The population is mostly of Indian,\
 African and European origin.")
