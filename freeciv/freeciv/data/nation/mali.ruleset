 for millennia. In medieval times, the region was home to a succession of\
 empires called the Sahelian kingdoms. Of these, the Islamic Mali Empire\
 was the most influential. This empire reigned from the 14th to the 17th\
 century and was famed for its wealth and benevolent kings. The modern\
 Republic of Mali derives its name from this empire.")
