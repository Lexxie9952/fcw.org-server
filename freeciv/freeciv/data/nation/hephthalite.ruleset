legend=_("The Hephthalites were a Central Asian nomadic confederation of\
 the 5th and 6th centuries CE. Their precise origins and composition remain\
 obscure. They may have been of mixed Iranic, Tocharian and Turkic origin,\
 but their main language is unknown. Although they were also known as the\
 White Huns, a connection with the Huns is considered unlikely. The\
 Hephthalites were crushed by the Göktürks and Sassanids in the 6th\
 century, but on the Indian subcontinent some Hephthalite successor\
 kingdoms survived until the late 7th century.")
