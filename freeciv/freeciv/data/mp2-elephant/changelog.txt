Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
 
   What motivates Ruleset additions
      
Focus goals for MP2-Elephant
   Simplify unnecessary complexities.
   Evolve movement system
      passive movement vs active movement: boats with horses shouldn't move on rivers faster, nor should trains
      movement costs for actions, movement dynamics over terrain, terrain improvements having finer control over 
         speeding/slowing movement, etc.
      min frags to move to next tile: allows a differentiation in being able to travel x tiles, from being able
         to travel there and fortfy, begin work, etc.
   Re-evaluate terrain: move costs, defense bonuses, special penalties and other dynamics.

   End virtual transportation. It's the only way for horses to not make virtual boats and rails faster. This means
      making cheaper weaker transports to replace it, perhaps even free ones. This can allow us to enhance 
      movement dynamics especially of rivers, even creating a ReverseRestrictInfra on them, etc.

   Granularity - while small integers like 1 and 2 are simpler, the power factor is 2/1 = 200%. Everything should 
      be elevated by a factor like 10 so that balance adjustments can properly come from small tweaks rather than
      always making new rules and exceptions to the rules. For MP2E, however, this is such a large jump that no 
      few fine adjustments will be made, so people may adjust to everything costing 10x more, attacking 10x more,
      moving 10x more, etc.
      * movement and move costs 

   Early Game - Blossom the early game even more, giving it the attention the late game got in earlier releases 
      (late game balance and tactics and number of units were far behind early game balance) 

   Fine-tune the more radical and experimental adjustments of MP2D.

   Evaluate Project Neptune changes and gradually evolve. Look more into new mechanics or other non-combat strength
      bonuses for ships to be improved:
         Movement, Vigil, Attack II (combat rounds).

   Project Infantry - time to really enrich it 
      Early game types
      Differentiate Napoleonic / WW1 / WW2 foot units better, partly through new units but partly through
         bonuses achieved from techs / vet levels / movement / etc. e.g., sub-techs for musket/rifle techs.
========================================================================================================================

1. Spy Planes are harder to shoot down because of mass, size, speed, and altitude. Correspondingly, they gain higher defense, 
and can now be built with veteran levels.
1a. Spy Planes get 75% chance to Stack Escape, since they are in a different "layer" of the tile, like subs.
2. Scout 10hp (was 8)
3. AWACS 30hp (was 20), moved to Rocketry (post WW2 tech: give Escort Fighters a purpose in WW2)
4. Rivers and Rails are now PASSIVE MOVEMENT: unit is assumed to be a passenger. Therefore Warriors, Horsemen, and Armor all move the same
   speed down a river. (don't forget to make it so: BigLand needs native to river again, we took it out!)
5. for simplicity, Canals are same as rivers regarding movement. i.,e., if canals are so great that battleships can use them, 
   why do we assume land types can't get on boats like they can for rivers? i.e., Canals are PassiveMovement, 6 moves.
6. increased vision of castle
7. new base watchtower, allows vision 
8. trains are actually active agents on passive road-type, so their +1 move bonus for electricity and combuston remains, as an active
   move bonus giving +5 and +5 tiles range, respectvely
9. new road type Highway uses 1/5 move instead of 1/3; gives a range of 10 for foot, 20 for mounted, 30 for motorized
10. smaller boats (Boats and Triremes) get +1 move point for moving faster on rivers, if they start their turn on a river.
11. like wagon and trawler, everyone can see a Boat's cargo.
12. 
13. Most first techs reduced in price to 15. HBR 24. Warrior Code: 18. Easier Bronze Age, more risk rushing out because missing out on things,
    more availability for early wonder choices and/or less penalty for pursuing them instead of new-gov-rush.
14. Mausoleum 170 - cheaper is another civil wonder bonus of it.
15. Carriers price reduce, 150. Carry 12.
16. default start with 4 tribesmen not 3 - help boost early despotism and bronze age even more: combat/defense, work, buidings, wonders!
17. "Russian Doll" rule, wagons and trucks can't board transports while they're carring their own cargo.
