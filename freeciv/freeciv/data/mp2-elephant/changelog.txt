Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
 
   What motivates Ruleset additions
      
Focus goals for MP2-Elephant
   Simplify unnecessary complexities.
   Evolve movement system
      passive movement vs active movement: boats with horses shouldn't move on rivers faster, nor should trains
      movement costs for actions, movement dynamics over terrain, terrain improvements having finer control over 
         speeding/slowing movement, etc.
      min frags to move to next tile: allows a differentiation in being able to travel x tiles, from being able
         to travel there and fortfy, begin work, etc.
   Re-evaluate terrain: move costs, defense bonuses, special penalties and other dynamics.

   End virtual transportation. It's the only way for horses to not make virtual boats and rails faster. This means
      making cheaper weaker transports to replace it, perhaps even free ones. This can allow us to enhance 
      movement dynamics especially of rivers, even creating a ReverseRestrictInfra on them, etc.

   Granularity - while small integers like 1 and 2 are simpler, the power factor is 2/1 = 200%. Everything should 
      be elevated by a factor like 10 so that balance adjustments can properly come from small tweaks rather than
      always making new rules and exceptions to the rules. For MP2E, however, this is such a large jump that no 
      few fine adjustments will be made, so people may adjust to everything costing 10x more, attacking 10x more,
      moving 10x more, etc.
      * movement and move costs 

   Early Game - Blossom the early game even more, giving it the attention the late game got in earlier releases 
      (late game balance and tactics and number of units were far behind early game balance) 

   Fine-tune the more radical and experimental adjustments of MP2D.

   Evaluate Project Neptune changes and gradually evolve. Look more into new mechanics or other non-combat strength
      bonuses for ships to be improved:
         Movement, Vigil, Attack II (combat rounds).

   Project Infantry - time to really enrich it 
      Early game types
      Differentiate Napoleonic / WW1 / WW2 foot units better, partly through new units but partly through
         bonuses achieved from techs / vet levels / movement / etc. e.g., sub-techs for musket/rifle techs.
========================================================================================================================

0. Attack and Defense strength are all 10x higher across the board. This makes a basic unit like the Warriors as 
   A10 D10 HP10. While this may be awkward for a week or so, it's really not so hard that it's 10,10,10 (all same and consistent),
   and more importantly we can avoid lots of decimals and awkward attack strengths, and fine-tune unit combat strength with a finer 
   shade. (Previouosly, the minimum higher strength you could give over A1 was A2, literally double strength and disallowing things 
   like +25%, +50%, etc!) 
1. Spy Planes are harder to shoot down because of mass, size, speed, and altitude. Correspondingly, they gain higher defense, 
and can now be built with veteran levels.
1a. Spy Planes get 75% chance to Stack Escape, since they are in a different "layer" of the tile, like subs.
2. Scout 10hp (was 8)
3. AWACS 30hp (was 20), moved to Rocketry (post WW2 tech: give Escort Fighters a purpose in WW2)
4. Rivers and Rails are now PASSIVE MOVEMENT: unit is assumed to be a passenger. Therefore Warriors, Horsemen, and Armor all move the same
   speed down a river. (don't forget to make it so: BigLand needs native to river again, we took it out!)
5. for simplicity, Canals are same as rivers regarding movement. i.,e., if canals are so great that battleships can use them, 
   why do we assume land types can't get on boats like they can for rivers? i.e., Canals are PassiveMovement, 6 moves.
6. increased vision of castle
7. new base watchtower, allows vision 
8. trains are actually active agents on passive road-type, so their +1 move bonus for electricity and combuston remains, as an active
   move bonus giving +5 and +5 tiles range, respectvely
9. new road type Highway uses 1/5 move instead of 1/3; gives a range of 10 for foot, 20 for mounted, 30 for motorized
10. smaller boats (Boats and Triremes) get +1 move point for moving faster on rivers, if they start their turn on a river.
11. like wagon and trawler, everyone can see a Boat's cargo.
12. 
13. Most first techs reduced in price to 15. HBR 24. Warrior Code: 18. Easier Bronze Age, more risk rushing out because missing out on things,
    more availability for early wonder choices and/or less penalty for pursuing them instead of new-gov-rush.
14. Mausoleum 170 - cheaper is another civil wonder bonus of it.
15. Carriers price reduce, 150. Carry 12.
16. default start with 4 tribesmen not 3 - help boost early despotism and bronze age even more: combat/defense, work, buidings, wonders!
17. "Russian Doll" rule, wagons and trucks can't board transports while they're carring their own cargo.
18. Cruise Missiles aren't field units. This penalty goes back to an earlier simpler less realistic game. At this point in MP2 evolution,
   making a CM a field unit causing unhappiness in every Aegis Cruiser carrying it, it's like Cannons getting extra unhappiness for each
   cannonball they carry.
19. Phalanxes get 1.5x attack bonus if they haven't moved. This is not cumulative to Agoge, but rather, Agoge expands the bonus to be 
    active always for a pure 15 in attack strength.
20. Bombs have no move cost to board but double move cost to deboard, which evens out on average; so why do it? Because this way it allows
   a newly made bomb to get on an aircraft on the same turn to be used without tired attack of 2/3 move point. In addition, bombs can't
   board while transported, as this would allow double moves of taking an Atom Bomb across the world in 14 trucks to blow up a target.
   (this is also partly implemented in MP2D but not in as much detail.)
   tbh after the server version of Sept28 is running everywhere this should be backported to MP2D also, because consistency is simplicity,
   and less changelog shit to read and differentiate also, less different version behaviours to remeember is what i mean.
21. Machine Tools changed to Mass Production for Advanced Flight (removes redundant req)
22. New unit Light Carrier 
23. (all rulesets, clarify again) Vigil Mechanics changed, will always attack if 5/6 odds
24. (all rulesets, clarify), Vigil Mechanics changed, units won't leave Vigil after doing it.
25. Magnum Turret Bombards take 1 move not 1 6/10... allows 3 bombards on invaders which is bettere than weak 2,
   or if 2 given saves moves for an attack!  Need to change docs for its SUA too.
26. Space.2 tech doubled in cost to 2460.
27. Howitzers go from 4mp to 3 1/3mp. On blank terrain they can travel the same number of tiles (just attack at 1/3 on the final move).
    On roads and rivers they travel 10 tiles instead of 12.
    On highways they travel tiles instead of 18 instead of 20 (which is higher than the 12 on roads of MP2D)
    On rails and maglev they travel 20 and 60 just like every other unit.
    REASONS: the 2x movement boost of Howitzer over Artillery was always problematic. These weapons are powerhouses which should
    require, as in real life, some tactical premeditations and preparatory movements to set up, rather than rushing down roads and 
    rails and slamming into whatever city or stack is there. Nevertheless, on MP2E highways they move farther than MP2D roads,
    and can move the same # of tiles over blank terrain, albeit not attack at full strength on the last move.
28. Coastal D costs 75, same as city walls. The 2x defense improvement that got the most complaints for being too common/too easy 
   to build and make navy irrelevant, was also the cheapest. This fixes that somewhat. Note: it costs 80 in Civ2.
29. The ability for Helicopters to see Submarines better (from Civ2) is finally live and operational in Freeciv! Helicopters can see
   submarines at 2 tiles distance instead of 1, which is to say, in a 5x5 box at which they are the centre. This effect counts for 
   Transport Helicopters also
30. Land units, early sea units cannot see adjacent submarines. All air units, and all military ships from Destroyer onward, can see adjacent subs.
31.
