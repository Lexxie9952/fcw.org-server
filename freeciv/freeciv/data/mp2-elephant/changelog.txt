Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.

   What motivates Ruleset additions

Focus goals for MP2-Elephant
   Compress phenomenon where first 25% of era history happens in first 50% of game length.
      (e.g., first quarter of game happening in first half of game length.) Goal: MP2D's T60 should be roughly T50 in MP2E
   Do the opposite and extend out a little more later game periods that seem to progress too fast. PROBLEM: ERAS THEN GO TOO FAST
   AND AREN'T FOUGHT IN. THE EARLY GAME WAS THE BEST FOR ENJOYMENT AND BALANCE.

   Simplify unnecessary complexities.
   Evolve movement system
      passive movement vs active movement: boats with horses shouldn't move on rivers faster, nor should trains
      movement costs for actions, movement dynamics over terrain, terrain improvements having finer control over
         speeding/slowing movement, etc.
      min frags to move to next tile: allows a differentiation in being able to travel x tiles, from being able
         to travel there and fortfy, begin work, etc.
   Re-evaluate terrain: move costs, defense bonuses, special penalties and other dynamics.

   Granularity - while small integers like 1 and 2 are simpler, the power factor is 2/1 = 200%. Everything should
      be elevated by a factor like 10 so that balance adjustments can properly come from small tweaks rather than
      always making new rules and exceptions to the rules. For MP2E, however, this is such a large jump that no
      few fine adjustments will be made, so people may adjust to everything costing 10x more, attacking 10x more,
      moving 10x more, etc.
      * movement and move costs

   Early Game - Blossom the early game even more, giving it the attention the late game got in earlier releases
      (late game balance and tactics and number of units were far behind early game balance)

   Fine-tune the more radical and experimental adjustments of MP2D.

   Evaluate Project Neptune changes and gradually evolve. Look more into new mechanics or other non-combat strength
      bonuses for ships to be improved:
         Movement, Vigil, Attack II (combat rounds).

   Project Infantry - time to really enrich it
      Early game types
      Differentiate Napoleonic / WW1 / WW2 foot units better, partly through new units but partly through
         bonuses achieved from techs / vet levels / movement / etc. e.g., sub-techs for musket/rifle techs.
========================================================================================================================

0. Attack and Defense strength are all 10x higher across the board. This makes a basic unit like the Warriors as
   A10 D10 HP10. However, the strengths are represented at 1/10 so A10 stll shows as A1. This allows fine-tuning
    unit combat strength with a finer shade. This is a developer note that does not affect gamer-level concerns.
1. Spy Planes are harder to shoot down because of mass, size, speed, and altitude. Correspondingly, they gain higher defense,
and can now be built with veteran levels.
1a. Spy Planes get 75% chance to Stack Escape, since they are in a different "layer" of the tile, like subs.
2. Scout 10hp (was 8), move bonuses from vet levels simplified to class.B bonuses for all igTer units
3. AWACS 30hp (was 20), moved to Rocketry (post WW2 tech: give Escort Fighters a purpose in WW2)
4. Rivers and Rails are now PASSIVE MOVEMENT: unit is assumed to be a passenger. Therefore Warriors, Horsemen, and Armor all move the same
   speed down a river. This is 1/8 of mp. This only effects Land-type units, Sea units aren't TerrainSpeed and are always 1mp wherever
   they go.
   A. Rivers gain hard-entry and hard-exit flags, using all move points to go from non-river tile to river tile and vice versa,
   simulating to difficulty of crossing an unbridged/unquayed river. Note: Marines and IgTer units are immune to this effect.
   B. Big Land units are native to rivers again. This implies certain differences and has certain reasons:
   ** New PassiveMovement cost of 1/8 effectively makes all units, including motor, get the same
         "virtual boat speed" now.
   ** this means motor units could now enter a mountain with a river.
   ** Allows Big Land to incur the restrictinfra hard entry/exit penalty for crossing rivers
   ** Allows coding the server so only units native-to-road-type get hard entry/exit, thus
        allowing trenches and similar to only affect native classes and some TerrainSpeed classes can ignore them.
5. For simplicity, Canals are same as rivers regarding movement. i.,e., if canals are so great that battleships can use them,
   why do we assume land types can't get on boats like they can for rivers? i.e., Canals are PassiveMovement, 1/8 mp,
   and have same hard-entry hard-exit rules as well. (A Canal is now effectively a river in every way except +1 trade.)
6. Increased vision of castle
7. New base watchtower, allows vision
8. Trains are actually active agents on passive road-type, so their +1 move bonus for electricity and combuston remains, as an active
   move bonus giving +5 and +5 tiles range, respectvely
9. New road type Highway uses 1/6 move instead of 1/3; gives a range of 12 for foot, 24 for mounted, 36 for motorized
10. Smaller boats (Boats and Triremes) get more moves and also get +2 move points for moving faster on rivers, if they start their turn on a river.
      this now makes Boats move at 8, same speed as unit using river without boat. This should enhance rivers as a key logistical aspect of
      early civilization, like they should be.
11. Like wagon and trawler, everyone can see a Boat's cargo.
12. Patriarch can gain vet levels like other diplomat types.
13. Most first techs reduced in price to 15. HBR 24. Warrior Code: 18. Easier Bronze Age, more risk rushing out because missing out on things,
    more availability for early wonder choices and/or less penalty for pursuing them instead of new-gov-rush.
14. Mausoleum 170 - cheaper is another civil wonder bonus of it.
15. Carriers price reduce, 150. Carry 12.
16. The ocean becomes ZOC enabled, but is a separate zone from ZOC-land. Units do NOT impose ZOC onto tiles they themselves can't go.
    This means typically, ships and land units can't impose ZOC on each other. The exceptions are 'shared domains' where both
      types can go:  canals, naval bases, and rivers (wood ships only). Impacts are:
         a. Sea tactics can be deepened. Former lack of sea tactics from 2x movemement + igZOC replaced with interesting depth.
         b. Nations can protect their rivers better by imposing ZOC along them.
         c. Conversely, ships on rivers can enforce prevention of land unit crossings.
17. "Russian Doll" rule, wagons and trucks can't board transports while they're carring their own cargo.
18. Cruise Missiles aren't field units. This penalty goes back to an earlier simpler less realistic game. At this point in MP2 evolution,
   making a CM a field unit causing unhappiness in every Aegis Cruiser carrying it, it's like Cannons getting extra unhappiness for each
   cannonball they carry.
19. Phalanxes and Pikemen get 1.5x attack bonus if they haven't moved. This is not cumulative to Agoge, but rather, Agoge expands the bonus to be
    active always for a pure 1.5 in attack strength.
20. Bombs have no move cost to board but double move cost to deboard, which evens out on average; so why do it? Because this way it allows
   a newly made bomb to get on an aircraft on the same turn. In addition, bombs can't board while transported, as this would allow double
   moves of taking an Atom Bomb across the world in 14 trucks to blow up a target.
   (this is also partly implemented in MP2D but not in as much detail.)
   tbh after the server version of Sept28 is running everywhere this should be backported to MP2D also, because consistency is simplicity,
   and less changelog shit to read and differentiate also, less different version behaviours to remeember is what i mean.
21. Machine Tools changed to Mass Production as req for Advanced Flight (removes redundant req)
22. New unit Light Carrier
23. (all rulesets, clarify again) Vigil Mechanics changed, will always attack if 5/6 odds
24. (all rulesets, clarify), Vigil Mechanics changed, units won't leave Vigil after doing it.
25. Magnum Turret Bombards take 1 move not 1 6/10... allows 3 bombards on invaders which is bettere than weak 2,
   or if 2 given saves moves for an attack!  Need to change docs for its SUA too.
26. Space.2 tech doubled in cost to 2460.
27. Howitzers go from 4mp to 3 1/3mp. On blank terrain they can travel the same number of tiles (just attack at 1/3 on the final move).
    On roads they travel 10 tiles instead of 12. On rivers, 7 instead of 12.
    On highways they travel 20 tiles (which is higher than the 12 on roads of MP2D)
    On rails and maglev they travel 28 and 70 just like every other unit.
    REASONS: the 2x movement boost of Howitzer over Artillery was always problematic. These weapons are powerhouses which should
    require, as in real life, some tactical premeditations and preparatory movements to set up, rather than rushing down roads and
    rails and slamming into whatever city or stack is there. Nevertheless, on MP2E highways they move farther than MP2D roads,
    and can move the same # of tiles over blank terrain, albeit not attack at full strength on the last move.
28. Coastal D costs 75, same as city walls. The 2x defense improvement that got the most complaints for being too common/too easy
   to build and make navy irrelevant, was also the cheapest. This fixes that somewhat. Note: it costs 80 in Civ2.
29. The ability for Helicopters to see Submarines better (from Civ2) is finally live and operational in Freeciv! Helicopters can see
   submarines at 2 tiles distance instead of 1, which is to say, in a 5x5 box at which they are the centre. This effect counts for
   Transport Helicopters also
30. Land units, early sea units cannot see adjacent submarines. All air units, and all military ships from Destroyer onward, can see adjacent subs.
31. Space.2 cost is now 6300 bulbs
32. New unit Penetration Bomber - has bonus of only 5 combat rounds when defending (4 attacks to kill), not a huge deal for manual
      interception (which usually doesn't happen on a 1 fuel unit), but can be a godsend for vigil interceptions, requiring 4 to knock it out
      this feature wasn't documented in the unit yet and the whole thing needs careful rethinking as it's bit OP in some ways and UnP in
      other ways and needs to seek its special role and cost a little better, the goal is EQUALITY in usefulness to JBomber but just in a
      different way allowing more tactical tools. Should maybe have max_attacks 1 or def. -1 less than JBomber.
33. Foot Soldiers min.speed is 1.5 moves. This doesn't increase max range at all but GREATLY increases mobility inside their natural range.
     e.g., a foot unit with 2 moves can attack and still have a move fraction left to fortify or retreat a tile. Note the max_range to
     min_speed ratio in original 1x is 1/1=100% actually more than 1.5/2 = 75% in 2x !! So this makes a lot of sense to improve for units
     plagued by mobility issues ever since 2x modification occurred. (see white paper)
34. (non-IgTer) Foot Soldiers gain class.A move bonuses for vet levels. Standard is v0-1 = 0; v2-3 + 1/3; v4-6 +2/3.
    (IgTer units receive slightly different class.B type bonus) v0-v2 = 0; v3-v4: +1/3, v5-v6: +2/3 (bonus kicks in 1 vet level higher)
         Reason: IgTer units already enjoy substantial move bonus from no terrain penalties
35. FootSoldiers get improved promotion odds: 50 33 20 goes 85 50 33, basically bumping all odds up one level.
36. FootSoldiers who didn't receive discounts in MP2C get ~10% discount. Musket:27, Riflemen:35, Partisan: 40, Alpine:45,
    Marines:50, Ground Troops:35, Paratroopers:50. Zealots which were 25 in MP2D receive discount also and are back to 20.
36A. Destroy City requires 3 units (2 support units) to do.
37. Modern FootSoldiers (Paratrooper, Ground Troops, get A8)
38. Mech.Inf can carry one Foot Soldier or AAA.
39. AWACS cost adjust: 125, was 140. Vision radius moderate increase. Attrition rate and other flight reconnaissance options disincentivized the cost.
40. Each new aviation tech upgrades Airplane range by +1 move (was +2). 6 techs started making it almost a cheap AWACS.
41. Marines, Ground Troops, and Paratroopers are simplified with same A8 D5.5; Marines however have stronger vet levels.
42. Passenger Transport costs:
    The general rule is that if a transport takes a whole turn to cross an ocean, the units on it shouldn't have full moves
    as if the voyage took no time for the passengers. The physics/mechanics that allowed this in the past may have made the
    game simple, but unfortunately created outlier cases with tragic loss of realism and shockingly counterintuitive exploits.
    All known examples of such exploits were squashed with unnatural and unintuitive rules for what's allowed to board/deboard
    when and where under what conditions, while new ones were always being found. The answer seems to be to embrace natural
    physics and by taking this medicine, fix all the other diseases.

    Therefore, in general, the percent of moves a transport uses in going somewhere, is and should be the percent of moves lost
    by its cargo. For casual and intuitive play this will generally seem to be the case. And the rules were already much better
    under initial playtesting. However, some adjustments to this rule do exist to smooth over some game mechanics, game balance,
    and ease-of-live playability. Please note the adjustments to the general rule:

      0% Goods/Freight, Civilian: Punishing ability to cash in on traderoutes/wonders/recycle is not relevant. Workers, etc.,
                                  were intended to enjoy logistical bonuses in efficiency from using transport/river/canal/quay
                                  infrastructural investment. Therefore, rule doesn't apply to these units.
      0% Bombs. (The move-point of Bomb-types is simply to allow it to be dropped in an attack, which it can always do.)
      0% Marines. (Keeps original movement abilities intact)
      0% AAA.     (AAA needs full moves to vigil, and we allow it to stay in vigil while transported.)
      50% Foot Soldiers - 50% accounts reflects flexibility of such units to go in/out quickly from transports and also was an opportunity
                          to give further balance to the ongoing project to punish Foot Soldiers less for their loss of mobility in 2x rulesets.
      50% Aircraft, Missiles - The high speed and "internal fuel" of these units is not meant to be 100% depleted and hampered by the
                                "slower speed" steps taken by the carriers. e.g., one Fighter (20mp) offloads from a
                                a carrier (10mp) before it moves 5 tiles, and another stays on and then takes off. The Fighter who offloaded
                                first could strike at a range of 20 while the other at a range of 5 + 10 = 15. Introducing an extra
                                level of "micromanagement" to offload aircraft and missiles you might intend to use, before moving
                                a Carrier, and then if deciding not to use them, landing them back again on the carrier. The 50%
                                passenger move cost penalty here just keeps the ratios clean to reduce this extra level of micromanagement.
                                move points
      75% land military non-foot; 50% + won't subtract if <= 3 moves left (aircraft, preserves vigil)

      *** In no case does a faster unit on a slower transport expend more than 1mp on the cargo, just to avoid the needlessness of
      micromanaging deboard/board to avoid losing more than 1 move per tile by staying on the transporter.

43. Spy Plane and Bombers (except Dive Bomber) are BadCityDefender. This adjusts the fact some have strong
    defensive capabilities in the air but are poor defenders to scramble for city defense.
44. Transport swapping rules greatly simplifed because of Passenger_Move_Cost.
    a. Bombs can swap transports in cities and airbases.
    b. Missiles can swap transports in cities and any no-stack-death base.
    b. Every other unit, IF transported, can swap.
45. Missiles have special rules. A missile launched this turn has strict options. It may:
 (1) Strike a target, or
 (2) Board transport in any city or no-stack-death "base"
 (3) Land in a friendly city (free short-range airlift rule).
 (4) Run out of fuel if not enough moves left to do (2) or (3) at TC.
Missiles boarding and transport swapping must be done in friendly city or base. No bases are native to missiles.
46. TiredAttack only applies to land units. Air and Sea weren't originally meant to have fractional moves_left but as it's now possible with
   the overhaul of the movement system, we keep things consistent with old rules and not add a complexity to worry about.
47. GSF max attacks per turn: 3 (was 4)
48. Spy Plane as defender limits to 5 combat rounds. Gets vision increase to be more than AWACS instead of same.
49. LandRoad and LandRail can't be embarked upon, only boarded
    (forces Transport Board enablers which restrict illegal units from boarding) (also MP2D)
** Missiles and Bombs lose all ability to embark (also MP2D)
** LandRoad can't embark if transporting (also MP2D)
50. Spaceship items cost 3 gold per shield. Penalizes gold pooling efforts while still leaving gold a semi-feasible resource for spacerace.
51. In foreign cities, Freight cannot recycle into spaceships or coinage (exploit prevention / game balance.)
52. After building Apollo Program, you can't relocate capital by building Palace. This prevents exploit where capital moves to new city
    every turn, preventing any collaborated effort to sabotage a space program.
53. Boats are capturable units. Land units can capture them only when they are on terrain that land units can themselves travel to, i.e.,
      rivers or canals.
54. War Galleys gain ability to capture but native terrain rules are in effect:  They may capture boats at sea. They may capture any capturable units
    on land but only on terrain War Galley can go on (i.e. rivers, canals). The usual restrictions apply for cities, bases, mountains, and multiple
    units on the tile.
55. Wooden ships get +1 move at V1 instead of V4. (Spices up the game tactically while giving a micro-boost to units known to be a bit slow.)
56. Palace-types (capital cities) gain +1 content citizen (matches original "pseudo-courthouse" behavior of Palace in historic rulesets, allows capital to have
      more prominence and interest in early game which can also enhance both pace and interest in the early game.)
57. Constitutional Monarchy max tax rates increased to 75% ... uses new 5% gradation feature and makes this gov. more competitive/long lasting as
     an option going past the mid-game perhaps.
58. Roman Colosseum (350): Entertainers only use 1 food. An entertainer that's 3 trade + 1 food (basically like an ocean tile without a harbor that
    selectively fine-tunes its trade output into luxury), makes the Roman Colosseum a much more interesting value proposition vis-a-vis Michelangelo.
    Especially for future communists, those who avoid Theology, and those in a situation of using entertainers over national luxury
    because needing more micro-control for some cities to rapture and not others.
59. Knights get an extra hitpoint, giving this late A4 D2 unit a little more distinction over much earlier units who have A4 or D2.
60. Scout II upgrades scout, gains light attacks, pillage, evasion/escape.
61. Boarding rules fixed to disallow boarding onto a LandRoad that's already cargo of another transporter.
62. Hut revealing map area goes from 7 tile radius to 8 tile radius.
GAME SPEED/PACE:
63. All nations start with 3 Founders.
64. Despotism starting city food bonus adjusted from +2 (+4 capital) to +5 (+10 capital).
65. Start gold changed to 90 (was 75).
66. Marco Polo 350 shields (basically speeds the game by 50 shields for this early obligatory wonder).
67. Civil Wonders all reduced in price by 10 shields. (See, however, change to Mausoleum).
68. Workers II promotion bonuses bump the numerator/divisor progression by 1, which makes them go from
   barely usable if you use a spreadsheet, to definitive, measurable and simpler:
veteran_power_fact = 100, 120, 125, 134 goes to:
veteran_power_fact = 100, 125, 134, 150
i.e., 6 in 5 (swamp), 5 in 4 (mine), 4 in 3 (angkor wat swamp drain) goes to:
      5 in 4 (mine), 4 in 3 (mine or nationalists/angkor wat time), 3 in 2 (irrigate).
69. More Multislot units:
   Pilgrims, Migrant, Workers II, Engineers, Trawler
   Train, Truck, Airplane, Cargo Plane, Cargo Ship, Balloon
   Diplomat, Spy
70. Fighter types may always vigil in a city or airbase, if they have half their moves or more.
71. Vigil range extended for fighter types:
   Fighter:          5 (was 2)
   Escort Fighter:   8 (was 3)
   Jet Fighter:      8 (was 3)
   Multi-Fighter     first turn fuel: no limit, second turn: less than 8 moves used. (was first turn of fuel only)
   Stealth-Multifighter: no change (can always vigil)
   Stealth Fighter:  12 (was 4)
72. For aircraft, Airbase healing increased to 20% for simplicity: same as a Fortress for Land units. (NEEDS A NOTE IN BASES.MP2E)
    (helicopters, 25%, same as MP2D, no change.)
73. MP2E also gets (forgottenly undocumented) changed to MP2D that airbases heal air units at the same rate as fortresses heal land units.
74. AAA can vigil in a city or base if they have their full move points left.
75. Battleships gain "NeverBlocked" flag to join CM, Marines, and Arm2 -- was needed something similar on the seas.
76. Secondary tech costs increased. Combu.2 610>>1200, Flight.2 750>>900, Radio.2 820>>900
77. Spies gain SentryAlways flag
78. Magna Carta cost reduced 270
79. Quay unloading/deboarding costs full moves except in Domestic Territory -- this completes the intended purpose of Quays being fully RestrictInfra (reminder, was also put in mp2d 17.Dec.2023)
80. Alpine Troops: automatically become A7 D7 (a virtual sub-type of Alpines with slightly different appearance), when Combined Arms is discovered. (doc it in Techs.mp2e online page also)
81. Combined Arms now automatically upgrades all Alpines, Riflemen, and Zealots when it is discovered:  no micro-management of moving units around for 4 gold upgrade prices.
82. Goods and Freight can use railroads because they are passive movement. They can't use Maglev because of their large cargo space requirements.
    This lessens some micromanagement pains and makes good sense too.
83. (also recent change to MP2D) - AEGIS and MSAM lose ability to defend their single tile from a successful nuclear detonation. Tile protection in a successful detonation is reserved for the Bunker base type.
84. (also recent change to MP2D) - AEGIS and MSAM instead get a 50% and 33% chance respectively to use their anti-aircraft capabilites to prevent aircraft-delivered nuclear bombs on adjacent tiles from detonating. AEGIS bad city defender applies to this.
85. (also recent change to MP2D) - Anti-Ballistic Missiles can intercept all nuclear-type missiles in a 5x5-minus corners area of effect, preventing their detonation. They have a 29% chance of doing so, or in other words, each two ABMs in
    radius, reduces the chance by 50%. (1 missile: 29%), 2 missiles: 50%, 4 missiles: 25%, 6 missiles: 12.5%, etc.
86. Added NukeSurvivalPct effects, regulating suvival odds for city pop, units in city, units on map, nukes in city, and nukes on map. See HELP>UNITS>Atom Bomb for more info
    75% of surviving units will be injured, and 25% unscathed. Different nukes have different strengths affecting survival percentages across the various categories.
    Note the M.A.D. corrective affect where nukes have less chance of being nuked, presumably because preciously stored underground for retaliation purposes.
87. New unit Cargo Plane.
88. Paratroopers totally reworked. Paradrop range reduced to 5. Can board/deboard at no move cost. Have no PASSENGER_MOVE_COST when transported by Cargo Plane.
   Paratroopers long had a special OP-exploitableness that no one used just because they were too weak. Adding more micromanagement for paradropping is not desirable but there was no other choice if the game was to be balanced and the unit
      finally become viable. Air defenses now have proper ability to prevent transport planes from easily paradropping in their interior, if deployed properly.
   As a courtesy for playability and lack of micromanagement, Paratroopers CAN paradrop within a 5 tile range, considered a quick and easy paradrop on more readily available planes than a dedicated military class Cargo Plane.
89. Discovery of Combined Arms gives a free Cargo Transport in the capital.
90. Combined Arms no longer requires computers but is demoted one tier; gets a third req mechanization instead. Reason: allow more advanced troops and capabilities. Before, by the time this tech was available, it was not as appealing as other available techs, and thus became much less relevant. In addition, this helps buff Project Infantry another step and makes necessity for Mech.Inf slightly less.
91. palace gives a multislot in early times
92. Hydrogen bomb cost increase to 200 (was 190).
93. In Despotism, cities can celebrate at size 2. (possibly reserved for tribalism when that gov is added?)
      Ongoing gradual project to decrease all-out pressure on rushing next gov and playing out some parts of Bronze Age.
      Possible slight more balance to equalize Monarchy-first and Republic-first (gives slightest corrective to the latter)
      Get closer to the goal that each gov is superior to next govs until you're "ready" for them.
94. Clarification of future questions: Lake-rivers defend at 1x (no defense bonus for river), and you can't fortify on river-lakes.
95. Well-diggers can't do mountain rivers. (Because they had to be made a different type to accomodate new river mechanics vis-a-vis Big Land units). It's an abuse of well-digger anyway to make all mountain river cities.
96. igTer units (Scout, Scout II, Partisan, Alpine Troops) all get uniform simplified move bonus with Veterancy
97. Ballista may Vigil or Ranged Attack with 1 move point remaining. Fort or City not required for either. R.A. loses only lose 1 move in doing so. This exception from other Ballistic class units is because they can't conventionally attack.
98. Temple of Artemis must be built before Monotheism
99. +1 minimum healing for TC in a city was removed. However, see below
100. Medicine tech gives the same effect as above, however not for mechanical units like armor, cannons, etc.
101. New wonder Basiliad of Caesarea
Slight damper on building lots of ancient wonders at inappropriate times when they're cheaper (may make slightly fewer wonders or incur more risk by being a wonder-monger)
102. Pyramids must be built before Democracy is discovered.
103. Roman Colosseum must be built before Gunpowder is discovered
104. Copernicus must be built before University is discovered.
105. Eifel Tower, must be built before Flight.
106. Gibraltar Fortress must be built before Mass Production.
107. Agoge must be built before Feudalism is discovered.
108. Great Wall must be built before you discover Gunpowder.
109. Magellan must be built before Electricity.
110. Michelangelo's Chapel must be built before Communism.
111. Shakespeare must be built before Refining.
112. Statue of Liberty must be built before Communism is discovered.
113. Sun Tzu must be built before Gunpowder.
114. Voyage of Darwin must be built before Electronics.
115. Medici Bank must be built before The Corporation.
116. Map Making reveals map around cities and units. (sqrt(40) and sqrt(29) respectively)
117. Chivalry req The Wheel instead of Horseback Riding; unlikely to make a game difference except cleans up tech tree (and is more realistic and slightly slows rare possibility of totally skipping bronze age)
118. Mech.Inf are 2 gold upkeep, a mid-point between 1 gold for foot soldiers and 1 shield for other units. This may slightly:
         help combat income inflation as MP2 heads toward larger more efficient mega cities
         give slight balance correction for usability of foot soldiers
         perhaps slightly reduce the ability to use multislots to pile invincible stacks of 200 mech.inf
119. Electricity requires Steam Engine as second req to keep proper continuity on upgrade path from Ironclads. Since Magnetism is req for Steam Engine it loses that req.
