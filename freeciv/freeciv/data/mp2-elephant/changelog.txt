Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
 
   What motivates Ruleset additions
      
Focus goals for MP2-Elephant
   Simplify unnecessary complexities.
   Evolve movement system
      passive movement vs active movement: boats with horses shouldn't move on rivers faster, nor should trains
      movement costs for actions, movement dynamics over terrain, terrain improvements having finer control over 
         speeding/slowing movement, etc.
      min frags to move to next tile: allows a differentiation in being able to travel x tiles, from being able
         to travel there and fortfy, begin work, etc.
   Re-evaluate terrain: move costs, defense bonuses, special penalties and other dynamics.

   Granularity - while small integers like 1 and 2 are simpler, the power factor is 2/1 = 200%. Everything should 
      be elevated by a factor like 10 so that balance adjustments can properly come from small tweaks rather than
      always making new rules and exceptions to the rules. For MP2E, however, this is such a large jump that no 
      few fine adjustments will be made, so people may adjust to everything costing 10x more, attacking 10x more,
      moving 10x more, etc.
      * movement and move costs 

   Early Game - Blossom the early game even more, giving it the attention the late game got in earlier releases 
      (late game balance and tactics and number of units were far behind early game balance) 

   Fine-tune the more radical and experimental adjustments of MP2D.

   Evaluate Project Neptune changes and gradually evolve. Look more into new mechanics or other non-combat strength
      bonuses for ships to be improved:
         Movement, Vigil, Attack II (combat rounds).

   Project Infantry - time to really enrich it 
      Early game types
      Differentiate Napoleonic / WW1 / WW2 foot units better, partly through new units but partly through
         bonuses achieved from techs / vet levels / movement / etc. e.g., sub-techs for musket/rifle techs.
========================================================================================================================

0. Attack and Defense strength are all 10x higher across the board. This makes a basic unit like the Warriors as 
   A10 D10 HP10. However, the strengths are represented at 1/10 so A10 stll shows as A1. This allows fine-tuning
    unit combat strength with a finer shade. This is a developer note that does not affect gamer-level concerns.
1. Spy Planes are harder to shoot down because of mass, size, speed, and altitude. Correspondingly, they gain higher defense, 
and can now be built with veteran levels.
1a. Spy Planes get 75% chance to Stack Escape, since they are in a different "layer" of the tile, like subs.
2. Scout 10hp (was 8)
3. AWACS 30hp (was 20), moved to Rocketry (post WW2 tech: give Escort Fighters a purpose in WW2)
4. Rivers and Rails are now PASSIVE MOVEMENT: unit is assumed to be a passenger. Therefore Warriors, Horsemen, and Armor all move the same
   speed down a river. This is 1/6 of mp. This only effects Land-type units, Sea units aren't TerrainSpeed and are always 1mp wherever
   they go.
   A. Rivers gain hard-entry and hard-exit flags, using all move points to go from non-river tile to river tile and vice versa, 
   simulating to difficulty of crossing an unbridged/unquayed river.
   B. Big Land units are native to rivers again. This implies certain differences and has certain reasons:
   ** New PassiveMovement cost of 1/6 effectively makes a move along a river 1mp, so that all units get the same
         "virtual boat speed" now. This is also the same move_speed as when  Big Land was non-native in mp2d. 
         So why the change? Several differences:
   ** Ends up using 1 move point when following a river to a forest/hill/mountain, instead of 2 or more.
   ** Does allow movement onto mountain river.
   ** Allows Big Land to incur the restrictinfra hard entry/exit penalty for crossing rivers
   ** Allows coding the server so only units native-to-road-type get hard entry/exit, thus
        allowing trenches and similar to only affect native classes and some TerrainSpeed classes can ignore them.
5. For simplicity, Canals are same as rivers regarding movement. i.,e., if canals are so great that battleships can use them, 
   why do we assume land types can't get on boats like they can for rivers? i.e., Canals are PassiveMovement, 1/6 mp, 
   and have same hard-entry hard-exit rules as well. (A Canal is now effectively a river in every way except +1 trade.)
6. Increased vision of castle
7. New base watchtower, allows vision 
8. Trains are actually active agents on passive road-type, so their +1 move bonus for electricity and combuston remains, as an active
   move bonus giving +5 and +5 tiles range, respectvely
9. New road type Highway uses 2/9 move instead of 1/3; gives a range of 9 for foot, 18 for mounted, 27 for motorized
10. Smaller boats (Boats and Triremes) get +1 move point for moving faster on rivers, if they start their turn on a river.
      this now makes Boats move at 6, same speed as unit using river without boat.
11. Like wagon and trawler, everyone can see a Boat's cargo.
12. Patriarch can gain vet levels like other diplomat types.
13. Most first techs reduced in price to 15. HBR 24. Warrior Code: 18. Easier Bronze Age, more risk rushing out because missing out on things,
    more availability for early wonder choices and/or less penalty for pursuing them instead of new-gov-rush.
14. Mausoleum 170 - cheaper is another civil wonder bonus of it.
15. Carriers price reduce, 150. Carry 12.
16. The ocean becomes ZOC enabled, but is a separate zone from ZOC-land. Units do NOT impose ZOC onto tiles they themselves can't go.
    This means typically, ships and land units can't impose ZOC on each other. The exceptions are 'shared domains' where both
      types can go:  canals, naval bases, and rivers (wood ships only). Impacts are:
         a. Sea tactics can be deepened. Former lack of sea tactics from 2x movemement + igZOC replaced with interesting depth.
         b. Nations can protect their rivers better by imposing ZOC along them.
         c. Conversely, ships on rivers can enforce prevention of land unit crossings.
17. "Russian Doll" rule, wagons and trucks can't board transports while they're carring their own cargo.
18. Cruise Missiles aren't field units. This penalty goes back to an earlier simpler less realistic game. At this point in MP2 evolution,
   making a CM a field unit causing unhappiness in every Aegis Cruiser carrying it, it's like Cannons getting extra unhappiness for each
   cannonball they carry.
19. Phalanxes and Pikemen get 1.5x attack bonus if they haven't moved. This is not cumulative to Agoge, but rather, Agoge expands the bonus to be 
    active always for a pure 15 in attack strength.
20. Bombs have no move cost to board but double move cost to deboard, which evens out on average; so why do it? Because this way it allows
   a newly made bomb to get on an aircraft on the same turn. In addition, bombs can't board while transported, as this would allow double
   moves of taking an Atom Bomb across the world in 14 trucks to blow up a target.
   (this is also partly implemented in MP2D but not in as much detail.)
   tbh after the server version of Sept28 is running everywhere this should be backported to MP2D also, because consistency is simplicity,
   and less changelog shit to read and differentiate also, less different version behaviours to remeember is what i mean.
21. Machine Tools changed to Mass Production as req for Advanced Flight (removes redundant req)
22. New unit Light Carrier
23. (all rulesets, clarify again) Vigil Mechanics changed, will always attack if 5/6 odds
24. (all rulesets, clarify), Vigil Mechanics changed, units won't leave Vigil after doing it.
25. Magnum Turret Bombards take 1 move not 1 6/10... allows 3 bombards on invaders which is bettere than weak 2,
   or if 2 given saves moves for an attack!  Need to change docs for its SUA too.
26. Space.2 tech doubled in cost to 2460.
27. Howitzers go from 4mp to 3 1/3mp. On blank terrain they can travel the same number of tiles (just attack at 1/3 on the final move).
    On roads they travel 10 tiles instead of 12. On rivers, 6 instead of 12.
    On highways they travel 15 tiles (which is higher than the 12 on roads of MP2D) [27Nov2022 this statement is correct]
    On rails and maglev they travel 20 and 40 just like every other unit.
    REASONS: the 2x movement boost of Howitzer over Artillery was always problematic. These weapons are powerhouses which should
    require, as in real life, some tactical premeditations and preparatory movements to set up, rather than rushing down roads and 
    rails and slamming into whatever city or stack is there. Nevertheless, on MP2E highways they move farther than MP2D roads,
    and can move the same # of tiles over blank terrain, albeit not attack at full strength on the last move.
28. Coastal D costs 75, same as city walls. The 2x defense improvement that got the most complaints for being too common/too easy 
   to build and make navy irrelevant, was also the cheapest. This fixes that somewhat. Note: it costs 80 in Civ2.
29. The ability for Helicopters to see Submarines better (from Civ2) is finally live and operational in Freeciv! Helicopters can see
   submarines at 2 tiles distance instead of 1, which is to say, in a 5x5 box at which they are the centre. This effect counts for 
   Transport Helicopters also
30. Land units, early sea units cannot see adjacent submarines. All air units, and all military ships from Destroyer onward, can see adjacent subs.
31. Space.2 cost is now 6300 bulbs
32. New unit Penetration Bomber - has bonus of only 5 combat rounds when defending (4 attacks to kill), not a huge deal for manual 
      interception (which usually doesn't happen on a 1 fuel unit), but can be a godsend for vigil interceptions, requiring 4 to knock it out
      this feature wasn't documented in the unit yet and the whole thing needs careful rethinking as it's bit OP in some ways and UnP in 
      other ways and needs to seek its special role and cost a little better, the goal is EQUALITY in usefulness to JBomber but just in a 
      different way allowing more tactical tools. Should maybe have max_attacks 1 or def. -1 less than JBomber.
33. Foot Soldiers min.speed is 1.5 moves. This doesn't increase max range at all but GREATLY increases mobility inside their natural range. 
     e.g., a foot unit with 2 moves can attack and still have a move fraction left to fortify or retreat a tile. Note the max_range to 
     min_speed ratio in original 1x is 1/1=100% actually more than 1.5/2 = 75% in 2x !! So this makes a lot of sense to improve for units
     plagued by mobility issues ever since 2x modification occurred. (see white paper)
34. Foot Soldiers gain bigger move bonuses with vet levels. Standard is v0-1 = 0; v2-3 + 1/3; v4-6 +2/3
35. FootSoldiers get improved promotion odds: 50 33 20 goes 85 50 33.
36. FootSoldiers who didn't receive discounts in MP2C get ~10% discount. Musket:27, Riflemen:35, Partisan: 40, Alpine:45,
    Marines:50, Ground Troops:35, Paratroopers:50.36. Destroy City requires 3 units (2 support units) to do. 
37. Modern FootSoldiers (Paratrooper, Ground Troops, get A8)
38. Mech.Inf get A7 attack, can carry one Foot Soldier or AAA.
39. AWACS cost adjust: 130, was 140. Attrition rate and other flight reconnaissance options disincentivized the cost.
40. Each new aviation tech upgrades Airplane range by +1 move (was +2). 6 techs started making it almost a cheap AWACS.
41. Marines, Ground Troops, and Paratroopers are simplified with same A8 D5.5; Marines however have stronger vet levels.
42. Passenger Transport costs: 
      0% land civilian and AAA/Marines; 
      50% Foot Soldiers, Aircraft, Missiles
      75% land military non-foot; 50% + won't subtract if <= 3 moves left (aircraft, preserves vigil)
43. Spy Plane and Bombers (except Dive Bomber) are BadCityDefender. This adjusts the fact some have strong 
    defensive capabilities in the air but are poor defenders to scramble for city defense.
44. Transport swapping rules greatly simplifed because of Passenger_Move_Cost.
    a. Bombs can swap transports in cities and airbases.
    b. Missiles can swap transports in cities and any no-stack-death base.
    b. Every other unit, IF transported, can swap.
45. Missiles have special rules. A missile launched this turn has strict options. It may: 
 (1) Strike a target, or
 (2) Board transport in any city or no-stack-death "base"
 (3) Land in a friendly city (free short-range airlift rule).
 (4) Run out of fuel if not enough moves left to do (2) or (3) at TC.
Missiles boarding and transport swapping must be done in friendly city or base. No bases are native to missiles.
46. TiredAttack only applies to land units. Air and Sea weren't meant originally to have fractional moves_left but as it's now possible with
   the overhaul of the movement system, we keep things consistent with old rules and not add a complexity to worry about.
47. GSF max attacks per turn: 3 (was 4)
48. Spy Plane as defender limits to 5 combat rounds.
49. LandRoad and LandRail can't be embarked upon, only boarded 
    (forces Transport Board enablers which restrict illegal units from boarding) (also MP2D)
** Missiles and Bombs lose all ability to embark (also MP2D)
** LandRoad can't embark if transporting (also MP2D)
50. Spaceship items cost 3 gold per shield. Penalizes gold pooling efforts while still leaving gold a semi-feasible resource for spacerace.
51. In foreign cities, Freight cannot recycle into spaceships or coinage (exploit prevention / game balance.)
52. After building Apollo Program, you can't relocate capital by building Palace. This prevents exploit where capital moves to new city 
    every turn, preventing any collaborated effort to sabotage a space program.
53. Boats are capturable units. Land units can capture them only when they are on terrain that land units can themselves travel to, i.e.,
      rivers or canals.
54. War Galleys gain ability to capture but native terrain rules are in effect:  They may capture boats at sea. They may capture any capturable units
    on land but only on terrain War Galley can go on (i.e. rivers, canals). The usual restrictions apply for cities, bases, mountains, and multiple
    units on the tile.
55. Wooden ships get +1 move at V1 instead of V4. (Spices up the game tactically while giving a micro-boost to units known to be a bit slow.)
